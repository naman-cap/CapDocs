User-created challenges let people set their own goals. Unlike milestones set by brands, this puts users in control. They create challenges for themselves and earn rewards for completing them.

For example, a fitness brand has an app that lets users create personal challenges. For instance, a user might set a goal to drink eight glasses of water every day. They log their water intake in the app. When they reach their goal consistently for a week, they earn points. These points can be used for discounts on fitness gear or healthy snacks. This way, users feel accomplished and get rewarded for taking care of their health.

> ðŸš§ Attention
>
> * Once a user-created target group is created, it cannot be changed to a default target.
> * Currently, a maximum of one Target Rule (expression) can be configured for a user-created target group.
> * The Target Rules created must be of the `enrolmentMethod` `IMPORT` for a user-created target group.

The following table list the APIs that can be used to create and get details of user-created challenges:
