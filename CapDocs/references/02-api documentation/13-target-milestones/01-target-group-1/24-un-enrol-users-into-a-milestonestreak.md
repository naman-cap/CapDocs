This API helps brands unenroll users from a milestone/streak depending on the brand's use case.

### **Case 1 (Milestones):**

Assume there is a milestone 'ABC' that has 5 cycles in it (c1, c2, c3, c4, c5).

**Sub-case 1:** The user has already enrolled in the milestone during the beginning of the c1.

Now if the user gets unenrolled during the middle of c1:

1. The user will get unenrolled from all the cycles including c1
2. If the user had already achieved the milestone before the unenrolling, and the milestone is of 'immediate reward allocation type', then the user would have already gotten the reward.
   1. However, if the milestone is of 'period-end reward allocation type', the user won't get the reward for c1 even though the user has achieved the target before the unenrolling.

**Sub-case 2:** The user has unenrolled in the middle of c3.

1. Whatever rewards (immediate type or period-end type) the user is supposed to get for the c1, and c2, the user would have already gotten them because the un-enrolment happened during the c3.
2. The user will get un-enrolled from all the cycles starting from c3 to the end.
3. The 2nd point mentioned in Sub-case1 will still hold here but this time with c3.

### Case 2 (Streaks):

Assume there is a streak 'XYZ' that has 30 cycles and 3 levels (4, 8, 12) in it.

**Sub-case 1:** The user has un-enrolled during the 13th cycle.

1. If the user has already achieved the levels (say 4, 8) before the un-enrolment, the user would have already gotten the benefits for them. In the case of streaks, we support only "immediate reward allocation".
2. The user will get un-enrolled from all the cycles from c13 to c30.
3. During the re-enroll, the brand could re-enroll the user by resetting (by making the resetStreakStatus as 'true'). This helps in letting the user achieve the streak (aka streak levels) again & again even though the user has achieved them before.
