Capillary supports three types of authentication:

1. **OAuth**\
   This auth flow is used when the API requests are made from a program or service running on a server. This flow uses an access token to authenticate an API request. You can enable oAuth from InTouch as mentioned in the respective section below.
2. **Basic auth**\
   This is used where POS terminals are directly integrated with Capillary server. This flow uses Till ID and MD5 hash encoded password to authenticate an API request. Find more details in the section below.
3. **Authentication for end-customer web and mobile apps**\
   This is used for end-customer authentication where you want end-customers to login to a mobile or web application built on Capillary CDP.

> 📘 It is mandatory to use only store-specific Till/Store Center credentials as API response depends on this identification.

## When to use Basic & OAuth?

| Authentication Type | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Basic**           | Can be used for POS integrations where API requests come to the Capillary server directly from POS front end or POS store server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **oAuth**           | Shall be used for backend integrations (from one backend to another backend). For example, POS integrations where API requests come to the Capillary server from an API gateway or a central server; FTP integrations where backend service needs to be authenticated; 3rd party integration where API requests come to Capillary from a backend platform. |
