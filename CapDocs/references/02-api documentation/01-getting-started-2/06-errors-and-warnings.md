API responses are generated at the request level and item level.

* Request Level Responses: These response codes are generated at the request level (for an entire request).
* Item Level Responses: These response codes are generated at individual items of a request.

For instance, assume that a batch API call is made to add multiple transactions. The entire request will have a status (successful, failed or partial success) and each transaction item will have its own response code element. You can see API level response in the element and item level in the element.

# Request level response codes

<Note title="Note">
There are two types of failure cases - Errors and Warnings. Errors occur when the main activity fails - it could be due to internal error or incorrect input. Warnings occur when the primary activity is succeeded, but the secondary activity/activities failed.
