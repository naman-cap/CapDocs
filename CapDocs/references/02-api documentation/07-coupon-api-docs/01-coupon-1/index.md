Coupon represents store promotions or discounts created through Capillary Campaign Manager. A single campaign could contain one or more coupons or coupon series. Coupons are issued to loyalty or non-loyalty customers through SMS or email.

You cannot create new coupons using coupon APIs. You can just send or retrieve coupons that are already created in your campaigns. Hence, it is important to note the coupon code, coupon id or coupon series id for making API calls.

The coupon entity allows you to perform the following tasks:

* Issue coupons to customers
* Resend a specific coupon to the respective customer
* Retrieve details of a specific coupon/coupon series
* Check whether a customer can redeem a specific coupon and redeem the coupon
