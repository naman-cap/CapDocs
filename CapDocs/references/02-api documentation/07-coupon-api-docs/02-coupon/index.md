Coupon represents store promotions or discounts created through Capillary Campaign Manager. A single campaign could contain one or more coupons or coupon series. Coupons are issued to loyalty or non-loyalty customers through SMS or email.

You cannot create new coupons using coupon APIs. You can just send or retrieve coupons that are already created in your campaigns. Hence, it is important to note the coupon code, coupon id or coupon series id for making API calls.

You cannot create new coupons using coupon APIs; instead, you can send or retrieve coupons that are already created in your campaigns. Hence, it is important to note the coupon code, coupon id or coupon series id to use coupon APIs.

The V2 coupon entity just allows you to -

* Redeem coupons in batch
* Check whether specific coupons can be redeemed or not

For any other coupon related APIs, please use v1.1 APIs.
