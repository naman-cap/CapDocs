A transaction represents a purchase or return event. Based on the customers’ loyalty status, transactions are categorized into three types.

- **Loyalty Transactions**: Transactions made by registered customers of your organization’s loyalty program. A customer can be tagged to a loyalty transaction.
- **Non-loyalty Transactions**: Transactions made by customers who are not registered into your loyalty program, but subscribed their mobile number or email id with the organization. These transactions are tagged to the respective identifiers (mobile no/email id)
- **Not-interested Transactions**: Transactions made by customers who are not interested to register into your organization’s loyalty program. These transactions are also considered as anonymous transactions.

Transactions are again classified into the following types:

- **Regular**: Normal transactions made at the PoS. Regular transactions could be loyalty, non-loyalty and not-interested.
- **Return** : Transactions that are returned at the PoS. Return transactions need an identifier reference. Hence, only loyalty and non-loyalty transactions can be returned through APIs. See Transaction Return API for more details.
- **Mixed**: A transaction that involves both regular and return is termed as mixed transaction.

The transaction entity contains all the necessary APIs to manage transactions and retrieve transaction details. The transaction entity stores regular/return transactions, points/coupons redeemed against transactions, retro transactions (converting not interested transactions to loyalty), extended fields, and custom fields.

For information on how the system handles different timezones, see [Handling different timezone](https://docs.capillarytech.com/reference/timezone-in-api-response).

> 📘 
> 
> Extended fields and custom fields in transactions are used to capture additional information of a transaction or transaction line-item. The extended fields are predefined defined in the system with specific values, whereas, custom fields can have any name and value as required for the org.

## Prerequisites

Before using transaction APIs, understand the transaction configurations of your organization. You can see the transaction related settings on InTouch > Settings > Systems & Deployment > InTouch PoS Configuration > Billing.

- Mandatory parameters required to submit a transaction
- Whether Retro Transaction is enabled to convert not-interested transactions to regular transactions and the maximum duration for which retro transaction is allowed
- Whether Authorization is required for retro transactions
- Whether Transaction Return is enabled for your organization (for transaction returns)
- Scope of transaction numbers to be unique (store level or TILL level) and duration for which repetition is not allowed (20 days, 30 days etc.)
- Maximum and minimum amount allowed per transaction
- Maximum and minimum amount allowed per line-item
