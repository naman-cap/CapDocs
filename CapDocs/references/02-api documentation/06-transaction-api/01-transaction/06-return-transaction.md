The following are different return types supported for a transaction.

1. Full Return: To return an entire transaction and exchange with different items
2. Line-item Return: To return line-item(s) of a transaction and exchange with other items
3. Mixed Return: To exchange one or more line items of a transaction (line-items)
4. Amount Return: To return the entire transaction amount

<Note title="Note">
s
* For return transactions, it is required to pass return item‚Äôs purchased transaction number and purchase\_ time . Purchase time: The date and time of the actual transaction \* Billing time: The date and time of the return transaction.
* Before using this API, you need to know the configurations set of the Return Transactions page of InTouch **Settings** > **Systems & Deployment** > **InTouch POS Configuration**.
* You can disable the configuration CONF\_POINTS\_RETURN\_ENABLED to prevent the reversal of earned points when a transaction is returned. When a user returns a transaction, the points earned for that transaction are not reversed. To reverse the points, you can use the [Manual Points Adjustment API](https://docs.capillarytech.com/reference/deduct-points-and-alternatecurrencies-from-user-using-userid#/). **To enable the configuration for your organisation, raise a JIRA ticket to the Capillary Product Support team.**

        Transaction ID of the transaction that needs to be returned.

        Identifies the specific transaction to be returned when identical bill numbers exist across different transactions.
        This is applicable when the CONF\_LOYALTY\_BILL\_NUMBER\_UNIQUE\_ONLY\_STORE configuration is enabled, and the same bill number is used for transactions at different stores.
        Example:
        Store A: Customer transaction with bill number B1
        Store B: Different transaction also with bill number B1
        In this scenario, you can include the transaction ID in the return transaction payload to:

        * Distinguish between transactions with identical bill numbers
        * Prevent failures in return transactions due to duplicate bill numbers
