The Loyalty Promotion are of three types:

* Available without issue - Accessible to all customers and automatically triggered based on predefined rules, behavioural events, or milestone completions. Benefits such as points, tier upgrades, coupons, or badges are directly provided when customers meet the defined criteria.
* Direct issue - A specific promotion is issued to customers based on their behaviour or transactions. Customers must meet the criteria during a future transaction to receive the benefits. This process is initiated through workflows like TransactionAdd or Behavioral events. 
* Enroll & Issue - Requires customers to opt in or enrol before receiving a promotion. Involves three steps: enrollment, completing specific actions, and receiving benefits. These promotions engage customers through an interactive approach, targeting specific audiences.
