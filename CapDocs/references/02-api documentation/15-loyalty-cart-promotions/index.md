To use cart promotions, you need to first generate an authentication token as an admin using the `/arya` API and then use the **BearerToken** authentication to make API calls.

You can also pass the token as a header. For example, the access token is xyz, then pass the header `AUTH-COOKIE` with value Bearer xyz

Note that only admins can make these promotion API calls.
