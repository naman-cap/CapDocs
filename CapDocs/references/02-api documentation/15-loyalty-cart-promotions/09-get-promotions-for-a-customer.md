This API retrieves cart promotions and Point-of-Sale (POS) promotions specifically tagged to a customer based on their user ID. This includes cart promotions directly issued to the customer and POS promotions associated with the customer's loyalty tier or supplementary programs.

<Callout icon="ðŸ“˜" theme="info">
  **Note**

  **The API returns POS promotions under the following conditions:**

  * Tier-Specific Promotions: If a promotion is configured for a specific loyalty tier (e.g., "Gold Tier") and the customer making the API call belongs to that tier, the promotion will be included in the response.
  * Supplementary Program Promotions: When the includeSupplementaryPromotions parameter in the API call is set to true, promotions linked to supplementary programs will be returned.

  **The API will not return POS promotions in these scenarios:**

  * "All Loyalty Customers" Promotions: Promotions broadly applicable to all loyalty members, without being tied to a particular tier, are not returned by this API.
  * No Tier or Supplementary Program Association: If a POS promotion is not explicitly linked to a customer tier or a supplementary program, it will not be part of the API's response.

        Promotion can have three statues: ACTIVE, INACTIVE, EXPIRED.

        * **ACTIVE** - The promotion is currently running and can be applied if all conditions are met. However, this status does not indicate whether the customer has already redeemed the promotion. For example, a birthday promotion may be active for an entire month, but this does not mean the customer is eligible to use it at all times. If the customer has already redeemed the promotion and has no more redemptions remaining, the status will still remain active. To check if a customer can still redeem the promotion, refer to `remainingRedemption`.
        * **INACTIVE** - Promotion exists in the system but is currently deactivated by an administrator.
        * **EXPIRED** - The end date for the promotion has passed and it is no longer active.
