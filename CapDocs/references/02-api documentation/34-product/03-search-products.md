### Search Query String

Attributes like price, item\_sku, description, img\_url are common for all the orgs.

Standard Query: `attribute:OPERATOR:value`

Search Query String is the URL encoded string containing the parameters used for searching. You can pass multiple params in the query with fixed operators separating each query string with `|`

For instance, assume that you want to retrieve all the products which matches any of the following

* Color: Black, blue, or green
* Size XL,
* Price range: 2000 - 4000
* Department: Men

Then the query string would be as shown below:

`q=(color:IN:Black;Blue;Green|size:EQUALS:XL|price:RANGE:2000;4000|department:EQUALS:Men)`

**URL Encoded String**:

`color%3AIN%3ABlack%3BBlue%3BGreen%7Csize%3AEQUALS%3AXL%7Cprice%3ARANGE%3A2000%3B4000%7Cdepartment%3AEQUALS%3AMen`

**Request URL**: https:`\{host\}`/v1.1/product/search?q=(color%3ain%3ablack%3bblue%3bgreen%7csize%3aequals%3axl%7cprice%3arange%3a2000%3b4000%7cdepartment%3aequals%3amen)\&format=`{xml/json}`

The following characters are not supported in search queries as they have a special meaning in search grammar. <br />\
`+ - && || ! ( ) {{`{ }}}`   ^ " ~ * ? : \`
