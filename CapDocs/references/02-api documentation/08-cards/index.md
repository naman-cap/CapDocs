Card enables orgs to run card based loyalty memberships with multiple card types. A customer can have multiple cards of a same or different series as intended by the org.

`Card Series` represents different types of cards of a brand. For example, Value Card, Premium card, Digital Card, and Physical Card. A card series stores information such as card series name, card type, card numbers, config details, and expiry details.

A card is either physical or digital and is associated with a Card Series. A card stores information such as issued date, expiry date, store or source account from which the card is issued, and current status.

Cards are specific to customers and not to source accounts. A customer can have multiple cards of the same card series. Issuing a card means linking a card to a customer. The following are the different types of cards supported.

* Create auto-generated physical/digital cards for a series.
* Issue cards when a customer is registered (supports org level or OU level)
* Create manually generated physical/digital cards for a series.
* Issue external cards (that are not created in Capillary)
