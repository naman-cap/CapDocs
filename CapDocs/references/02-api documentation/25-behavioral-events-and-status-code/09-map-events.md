title: Map Events (Adapter)
excerpt: >-
  Lets you map a custom event to the defaultTransformer (standard fields). Use
  this if you do not want need field level mapping and consider only standard
  fields for the event.


  For example, if you create a custom event by directly adding one or more
  standard events without creating new custom fields, you can map the event to
  `defaultTransformer`.


  You can also map a transformer to an event and associate event fields (mapping
  with custom fields).
