> Points cannot be issued through APIs. It can be issued only through modules such as Loyalty Manager, Data Import and Member Care.

The APIs of points entity are interdependent. For example, to redeem points, first you need to check whether a customer can redeem those points (`isredeemable`), validate customerâ€™s registered mobile number by issuing validation code, and then redeem points using the validation code received by the customer.

The points entity allows you to perform the following tasks -

* Check whether a specific number of points can be redeemed by a customer
* Issue validation code to the registered mobile number/email id to validate customer
* Redeem points using the validation code received by the customer
