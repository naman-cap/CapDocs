An OTP template is a predefined format or structure for sending One-Time Passwords (OTPs). An OTP template includes placeholders for the one-time password, expiration time, and other details as required.\
**Example:** Dear user, your one-time password (OTP) is: \{\{otp\_code}}. This OTP is valid for the next 10 minutes.
