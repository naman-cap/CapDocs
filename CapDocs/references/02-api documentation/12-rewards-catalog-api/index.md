Rewards catalog is a platform where brands can create rewards that the customers can purchase against their loyalty points. Rewards could be points, coupons, gift vouchers, cart promotions, or products from third-party vendors.

<Note title="Note">
s
* Postman Collection for the APIs can be requested through Capillary Support during or after onboarding the org.
* There is no limit on the number of rewards you can create.
* New brands should no longer use the **"intouch points"** field. Instead, they should only use the new **"payment config"** block.
