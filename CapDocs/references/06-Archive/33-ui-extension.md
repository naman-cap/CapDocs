# Key Features

**Application Management:** Create, configure, and manage applications directly within the Vulcan UI.

**Access Control:** Provides various access levels and permissions, including viewer, developer, and admin access to control user capabilities.

**Deployment Configuration:** Facilitates setting up and deploying applications using the Vulcan UI.

**Preconfigured SDK and CLI:** Ready-to-use SDKs and CLI tools with boilerplate code for easy initialization and setup. Components such as Bugsnag, source maps, and test setups, are optional.

**Apps Platform:** The Apps Platform allows developers to create, host, and maintain applications. It supports uploading builds for QA and production environments and enables both preview and live modes.

**Compatibility:** Vulcan supports Capillary UX and UI library components, including Member Care and Loyalty UI. It also allows applications to function as microsites that can be imported into core UI applications, such as Member Care UI.

# Use Cases

**Internal Application Development:** Enables the development of internal applications compatible with Member Care.\
For example, Vulcan can be used to extend the Member Care UI to cater to the specific requirements of a brand.

**External Microsite Development:** Facilitates the creation of external microsites that integrate seamlessly with core applications.\
For example, Vulcan can be used to create a rewards catalog microsite that can be integrated on to Member Care.
