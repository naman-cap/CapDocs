CDP is one step solution for all your data integration needs. It provides following integration capabilities:-

**1. APIs** - You can build integrations with POS, Ecommerce platforms or any data sources using our APIs. The documentation covers everything about our APIs. Read [API Building Blocks](https://docs.capillarytech.com/reference/key-concepts), [API Reference Guides](https://docs.capillarytech.com/reference/customer-1) and [Integration Guides](https://docs.capillarytech.com/reference/quick-start)

**2. API Gateway** - Our in-house built API Gateway enables customization of APIs so as to reduce integration effort needed at data source level. 

**3. Mobile APIs**- Our Mobile APIs are built upon our API gateway which are suited for mobile app development. We have standard mobile APIs, and custom APIs can be created on need basis. Our mobile APIs are accompanied with [authorization flows for mobile apps](https://docs.capillarytech.com/reference/customer-authentation). 

*Access to API Gateway and Mobile APIs are limited at the moment. They can be availed by contacting our Professional Services team.*
