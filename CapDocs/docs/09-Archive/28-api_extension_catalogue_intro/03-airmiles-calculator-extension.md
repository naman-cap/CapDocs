This extension allows brands from the Airline vertical to perform the following:

* Calculate miles for various origins and destinations based on multiple algorithms and add to the `ticketed_points_mileage` parameter during a transaction addition. The supported mileage calculation algorithms include the Haversine formula and Vincentyâ€™s formula.\
  **NOTE:** Capillary maintains an up-to-date airport code list based on the Global Airport List, which includes precise latitude and longitude details for each origin and destination. When you input an origin and destination, the system validates and calculates the mile points accurately by utilizing the longitude and latitude data. You can raise a JIRA ticket if any of the origin/destinations are not available.
* City-pair-based air miles - This feature enables airlines exceptions for air miles in specific routes. At present, the system considers only the origin and destination and excludes layovers and transits.
* Set minimum miles value - If the miles calculated for an origin-destination is less than this value, the minimum miles value set is provided to the customer.

9. To disable, click **Disable**.\
   As a result of the next transaction ADD API call, the system will skip miles calculation, and the data will not be captured in the `ticketed_points_mileage `parameter or displayed in the transaction details on the UI. The origin, destination and other extension fields including `ticketed_points_mileage` are permanent and do not change.
