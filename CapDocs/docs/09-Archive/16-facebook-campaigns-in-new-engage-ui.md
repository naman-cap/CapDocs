Facebook is one of the most scalable and popular ad platforms to reach customers. In addition to subscribed customers and new customer acquisition, It is a great alternative to reach DND and DNC customers.

Engage+ Facebook integration allows the user to post ads on Facebook to improve branding, recall and communicate announcements to the existing customer base to increase conversions. 

## Integrate Facebook Ad account with Engage+

The first step to running Facebook Campaigns through Engage+ is to integrate Ad Account. This can be done by following these steps:

* Navigate to **Settings** > **Account Integrations Section**

* Under the Facebook Ads section, click on Add Account details. Only one Ad Account can be integrated at a time with Engage+

> 👍 Facebook Business Manager Account
>
> A Facebook business manager is a user account just like a personal Facebook account that is used to run ad campaigns. A user can have access to multiple Ad Accounts that are granted to him by the admins of each account. All the Ad Accounts that the user has access to and its associated assets will then be listed on his business manager account.
