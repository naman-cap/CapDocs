## September releases

### Enhancements in Advanced Options of Explore Mode

Explore Mode allows users to slice and dice the charts using Advanced options. However, some enhancements were required to improve the presentation and usability of these Advanced options to make them much more intuitive and user-friendly.

With this release, users will be able to better analyze the charts.

#### Use cases

**Use Case 1**: 

Analyze KPIs across the same event:  While checking overall sales, loyalty sales, or non-loyalty sales across attributes, you can apply one attribute to all KPIs together by just enabling the toggle button. This helps to analyze the KPIs across the same “event” - ex: last update date, bill conversion date, latest date, etc. Analyzing KPIs across the same base attribute provides the correct picture of the business

**Use Case 2**: 

Prioritization of KPIs and Attributes - While analyzing acquisitions or registrations across customer tiers, Dates, and other KPIs, by using the newly introduced prioritization feature, one can easily view charts via multiple perspectives. 

For example, Dates can be prioritized to view date-wise registration or tiers can be prioritized to view which dates have been more fruitful for acquisitions.

### Toggle button to enable users to apply a specific option across all KPIs

While checking overall sales, loyalty sales, or non-loyalty sales across attributes, you can apply one attribute to all KPIs together by just enabling the toggle button. This helps to analyze the KPIs across the same event. For example, last update date, bill conversion date, latest date, etc. Analyzing KPIs across the same base attribute provides a correct picture of the business.
