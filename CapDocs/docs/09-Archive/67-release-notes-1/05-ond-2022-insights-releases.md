## Making text search case insensitive in Insights

### Problem Statement -

Currently, the end validity for scheduled exports is a maximum of one year and creators of the scheduled exports do not receive an expiry alert notification when the schedules are about to expire. A new duplicate export with a unique name must be created every time for the same expired export.

* As a brand, I want to know which of my exports are about to expire
* As a creator of the export, I want to extend the end validity date of my exports before they cross the expiration date.

### Solution -
