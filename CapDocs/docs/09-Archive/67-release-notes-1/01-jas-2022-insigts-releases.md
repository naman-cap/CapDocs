### Problem Statement:

The current landing page of Insights+, reports listing page has all reports listed without any proper grouping and structure.\
The users find it difficult and tiresome to everytime search for  the reports that they wish to see\
Lack of structure in the listing page tends to discourage the users to find meaningful usage of Insights+ and leads to transactional engagement at best\
Landing Page of Insights+ lacks standardization which could have led to greater ease of use

### Use Cases:

Below are the use cases :

* As a user you would want to discover and access your reports easily 
* View your Standard Reports upfront with minimal efforts.
* Easily identify your  product - wise reports.
* Smoothly navigate across  all the modules of the Insights+
* Discover reports/charts containing specific KPI/s

### Solution:

On the Landing page of Insights+, we have a Navigation Panel on the left side of the screen. The Navigation Panel will help you to traverse smoothly across the different modules of the product. The panel ensures better accessibility and discoverability of Reports .

Navigation Panel has following features and flows:

The reports are grouped under different categories in the navigation panel.\
For each of the products namely Engage+ , Loyalty+ , CDP and SmartStore+ , the Standard reports are listed in the Navigation Panel upfront.\

To view the list of custom reports, the user can simply click on the custom report tab in the Navigation Panel.\
Users can also navigate to the reports created by him/her and the ones marked as favorite via the Navigation Panel

The sub - sections of the different modules of the product are listed upfront and one can directly navigate to that page/section.\
