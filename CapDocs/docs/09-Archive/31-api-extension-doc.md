Capillary's API extension also called Neo Extension is a low-code tool that simplifies API development, empowering brands to create, update and customise APIs tailored to their specific business needs. It provides building blocks and libraries to configure various API components to set up validation rules, transform data, and handle API requests. 

With Neo Extension, you can create an API by defining the code flow and managing outputs and errors using the node-based user interface. It modifies and extends API functionalities, empowering developers to build on the Capillary framework without starting from scratch or handling infrastructure management. 

The node-based API builder has a short learning curve, making it easy for new users to grasp the APIâ€™s structure and functionality. This enables you to develop and deploy custom APIs rapidly and further allows you to create brand-specific applications.

# Key features

Below are the key features of the Neo extension

* User-Friendly Interface - Neo extensions offer a user-friendly interface for creating APIs with minimal coding. This is accomplished using pre-defined blocks.
* Secure - Only authenticated calls reach Neo, enhancing security. B2B authentication occurs at the api-gateway, while B2C authentication happens at the sol-api-gateway.
* Validation blocks - The validation block consists of a schema for the validation process, simplifying the process.\
  Data transformation blocks - Using data transformation, you can modify and manipulate data before processing. Using the script block, you can transform data to meet the requirements of the next stages in the workflow.
* Request blocks - The request block handles the API request. Here, you can define the URL, method, and authentication headers.
* Integration - Integrates well with the Capillary framework making it easy to build functionalities.\
  Flexibility - Neo extensions offer the flexibility to tailor the software to meet specific needs without requiring changes to the original code.
* Enhancement - Extensions allow users to add new features and functionalities to the base software, providing customisation and improving the user experience.

# Use Cases

## API Chaining

API chaining involves creating a sequence of API calls, where the API of one API request serves as the input for the next request. This allows for executing a multi-step process in an automated and streamlined manner. 

## API Re-mapping

Sometimes, different systems need to communicate with each other even though they use different types of APIs. For example, SOAP is an older type of API that focuses on reliability, while REST is a newer type of API that is more flexible and easier to use. Most modern applications use REST APIs as they are easier to use and can handle more tasks. With Neo Extension, you can convert a SOAP to a REST API. This makes it easier for different systems to work together seamlessly.

## Creating Brand-Specific Functionalities

Neo extensions enable you to create brand-specific applications. For example, a punches calculator for a hotel brand.
