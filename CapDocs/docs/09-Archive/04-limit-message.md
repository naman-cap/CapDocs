When you run several campaigns at once, thereâ€™s a risk that the same customer may receive too many messages, either on the same day or across multiple days resulting in customer dissatisfaction. To prevent this, it allows you to limit the number of messages to be sent for each communication channel and overall messages. For each channel, you can set daily, weekly, and monthly limit.

**Access Requirements**

By default, users do not have access to enable the communication limits feature for an org. If authenticated users need access, raise a JIRA ticket and assign it to the Engage+ Developer team.

Time Period Definitions:

* Day = From 12:00 AM to 11:59 PM (same calendar day)
* Week = From Sunday 12:00 AM to Saturday 11:59 PM
* Month: From 12:00 AM on the first of a month until 11:59 PM on the last day of the same month\
