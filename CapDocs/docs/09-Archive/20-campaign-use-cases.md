# Creating a birthday campaign

A birthday campaign is a type of campaign that issues coupons to customers to celebrate their birthdays. This can be set up by creating a campaign and filtering customers based on their birthday month to issue the coupon. This helps customers receive a personalized discount or offer as a birthday gift, making them feel valued and appreciated.
