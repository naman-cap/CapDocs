In a scenario where the export job has been executed, you can reuse it with modifications without creating a new job all together. You can do so by duplicating the existing job and modifying it as needed.

To duplicate a job, perform the following:

1. On the **Export Schedules** page, click the job that you want to duplicate. Click **Duplicate**. Alternatively, click **More** options of the desired schedule, from the list of schedules and click **Duplicate**.

All templates from the previous export are displayed in the new job, retaining the same properties.

2. Fill out all the details of the export job as needed. Refer [Create an Export Job](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/create-an-export-job-step-1-of-3-1) for guidance on the fields.
3. Click **Create** to save the changes and create the schedule.
