With Partner Broadcast Campaigns, you can issue only coupons or points without sending a communication. Further, there is a provision to export incentivesaudience and audience-related information along with incentive details to an FTP location.\
You can use this for orgs that want to use Capillary Engage+ to create audience lists and incentives (points or coupons) but use an external tool to send messages.

The following are the different types of partner broadcast campaigns.

* Incentives only campaign
* No communication message campaign 

## Incentives only campaign

You can assign offers and points to customers without sending any communication. For example, you can create an offer with a static coupon and assign it to an audience list. You can then send a communication to the selected audience using some external tool.

To create an incentives only campaign:

1. Create a Campaign and navigate to the **New Message** creation page.

2. In **Audience**, add your preferred audience lists to the campaign and navigate to the Content section. You can create an audience list in the following ways - [using filters](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/audience-management#using-audience-filters), [uploading CSV](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/audience-management#upload-csv-file), [combining existing lists](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/audience-management#combine-existing-lists).

## No communication message campaign

For FTP-enabled orgs, the *No Communication FTP Campaign* allows configuring only incentives (coupons/points) without any communications and exporting the data to an FTP server. The org can get the campaign details from the FTP server and can use the data to send communications using a third-party application.\
