# Contact Info


Whenever a campaign is run, the brand sends multiple messages to the customers. Each row in this fact table captures the communication that is done with the customer, as a part of the campaign. It captures data such as the date and time when the customer was contacted, the time when the customer accessed the campaign email, the channel used for communication (SMS, Whatsapp, etc.), and more. This fact table is linked to multiple dimension tables, which store the communication related attributes.

# Bill Line Items


The Bill Line Items fact table provides a granular level view of each transaction at the line item level. For instance, if a customer buys 5 items in a single transaction, the table would contain 5 rows corresponding to each line item. This table captures the information such as bill amount, discount, GST details, line item description, quantity, price, etc.

## Introduction to Badges Facts Tables


Badges are a type of visual recognition used in loyalty programs to reward customers for their progress, specific actions or achievements. They act as a form of gamification and instill a sense of pride and accomplishment within the user, thus, reinforcing the targeted behaviors and boosting engagement.

For more information about how badges work in Capillary product suite, please refer to the [Badges Documentation](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/introduction-to-badges).  This part of the documentation covers how you can analyze and report on badges featured in the Capillary system.

There are a few crucial elements of Badges lifecycle which a user would like to track and analyze. They include events such as earning a badge (without enrolment), the issual of badge (based on enrolment) and the promotions linked with the badge. The information of these events are stored in the form of fact and dimension tables based on star schema.  
The fact tables store the details of these events and the corresponding dimension tables contain the fields on the basis of which the entries in these fact tables can be grouped/filtered for reporting.

## Badges - Earn (badges_earn)


Each row in this table represents an event in which a customer earns a badge on completing a specified activity or meeting a set of pre-defined criteria. This doesn’t require the customer to enrol for the badge beforehand. It captures information like the badge ID, customer ID, earning date, expiry date, and whether the badge is active or revoked.

For example-  
When a customer registers, they automatically receive the "New Member" badge if the configuration specifies that pre-enrollment is not needed. These types of events are stored in the Badges_earn fact table.  
By linking this fact table with the dimension tables, you would be able to have a complete picture of this event.

## Badges - Issue (badges_issue)


Each row in this table represents the event, where the customer has to enrol in the badge before they can earn it. It captures information like the badge ID, customer ID, issuance date, expiry date, and whether the badge is active or revoked.

For example-  
A brand launches a campaign to ensure proactive engagement. In this campaign, the first 1000 participants would have the opportunity to become premium members. As configured, the "premium member" badge requires pre-enrollment. Therefore, such types of events are stored in this table.

## Badges - Earned benefit (badges_earned_benefits)


Each row in this table represents the event, wherein the promotions or benefits are linked to the badge. It captures information on the benefit type, coupon code, points earned, and validity of the benefit that comes along.

For example-  
A brand wants to run a campaign where customers who purchase items worth Rs. 10,000 during the campaign will earn a "Super Customer" badge. Additionally, the brand will provide extra coupons to "Super Customers." Here, the event of badge creation is linked to a promotion, and thus such events will be captured in this table.
