  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        CUSTOMER IDENTIFIER\*

        (MANDATORY)
      </td>

      <td>
        This is a mandatory attribute for an event and is used to identify an existing customer and also to register a new customer if required. 

        You need to configure identifier type, source, and associated source account.

        * Customer Identifier: Choose the identifier type from the available options - Mobile number, email ID, external id, WeChat ID, Martjack ID.
        * **Source**: Choose the source from which you want to identify customers. Facebook, WebEngage, WeChat, Instore, Martjack, TMall, Taobao, JD, e-Commerce, Website, Line, and other sources.
        * **Source Account**: For sources with multiple accounts, such as WeChat or Facebook, choose the desired account to identify registered customers from that source account.
        * **Add customer if not available**: Enable this option to automatically register new customers (in loyalty program) that are captured through the event.

        For example, if you set customer identifier as email ID, and Source as InStore, 

        * when an email id that is already registered on InStore is identified, the data is tagged to the customer and saved in the Capillary system
        * when a new email id identified, the customer will be first registered **if Add customer id not already present** is enabled. The event details tagged to the customer before saving the data.
