Once you create an event, you need to test and publish it. To test an event, you can either pass the data in the supported format either in the code from where you want to implement or through API. To test event data, you will need the following.

1. Get the Webhook URL of the respective integration.
2. Get the JSON payload of the event that contains all the necessary and optional parameters as configured.
3. POST event data to the Webhook URL.
4. Publish the event (If the data is pushed to Webhook successfully).

The detailed instructions on each step are provided in the following.

1. **Copy the JSON payload of the event. This will contain the parameters to pass for the event**.

To get the JSON payload, follow these steps.

```
1. Click on the event that you want to test and navigate to the { }**Code** tab.
