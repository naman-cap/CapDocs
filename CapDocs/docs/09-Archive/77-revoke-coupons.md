When a cashier redeems a coupon in case of an internet outage, you can expire such coupons instead of doing a manual cleanup at the backend. 

For a coupon series or offer, you have the following options for expiring coupons.

* All coupons that are not redeemed - from both issued and unissued.
* Only unissued coupons.
* All active coupons of a customer(s) 

<Note title="Note">
s
* You cannot revoke redeemed coupons.
* If a customer has multiple active coupons from the same series, then all active coupons are revoked.
</Note>

To expire active coupons, follow these steps. 

1. On the Engage+ home page, click **Incentives**.
2. Navigate to the incentive that you want to revoke, hover the pointer over the more options (â€¦) symbol.
