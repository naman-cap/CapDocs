# Tracking target

To track the targets that you have created, perform the following:

1. Create a chart using the same KPI and dimension that you used to set the target. For information on creating a chart, refer to the [documentation on creating charts](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/create-normal-migration-charts#create-normal-chart).
2. Add the chart to a report. For information on adding a chart to a report, refer to the [documentation on reports](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/custom-report).
3. From the **Reports**, open the report with the KPI and dimension that you used to configure and create the target and filter the dates accordingly.\
   The chart displays the target values. You can use the hide/view icon to view or hide the target from the chart.
