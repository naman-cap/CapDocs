## View Dimension Attribute Level Data in Charts

A dimension is an attribute by which you can split the data. Dimensions can be applied to a KPI and cannot stand alone. For example, you can see store-wise data for transactions KPI, and product-wise data for sales KPI. Dimensions are available only for chart cards.

**Note**: Dimensions are not applicable for chart cards. 

### Add dimensions to a chart:

1. Open a report and scroll down to the chart card for which you want to apply dimensions\
   A report will have the default dimensions selected by default and also termed primary dimensions. These dimensions are tagged while creating a report. You can replace primary dimensions with the same type of attribute values using the drop-down available.

2. To add more dimensions, Click **+/- Dim**. Secondary Dimensions are the other supported dimension attributes of a chart.
