A report is a combination of charts that provides essential insights of a business based on KPIs and dimensions.

A report consists of scorecards/chart cards. A scorecard is a numeric representation of a single KPI, whereas a chart card is a visual representation of the combination of two or more KPIs or a KPI and dimension. The chart could be a pie diagram, bar graph, line chart, area chart, or table and you will see only visualization options that are supported for a chart.
