# UI extensions on Capillary platform (Vulcan Framework)

Vulcan is a react-based UI framework using which you can create customized UI screens & embed them on Capillary platform. As of now, you can use it to create any react based UI application behind intouch authentication and embed it on Membercare. Long term vision being you would be able to create any UI application & embed it in any intouch module apart from creating external applications.

Overall, we seek to replace our Sharingan framework which was based on PHP tech-stack with this new framework. However, it’s not just the tech-stack upgrade that we get as a part of Vulcan; it is more secure & integrates seamlessly with our Intouch UI. From these UI extension applications, you can access any Capillary API (Intouch APIs, Node APIs, API Extensions based APIs) and UI design elements out of the box.

To know more on how you can create a new application, host it on Capillary platform & embed it in Intouch UI, checkout the documentation on UI extensions [here](https://docs.capillarytech.com/reference/ui-extension).

## Membercare Customizations using Vulcan

Over the past few quarters, we have been receiving a number of customization requests on Membercare. These customizations range from very basic ones like removing a widget from a screen to very complex ones like changing the search functionality/ redoing the layout of Membercare.

To cater to these requests, we have created a Vulcan replica of our existing Member Care product (yes, Vulcan is that powerful!) & are making it available on the platform.\
For now, we are suggesting that if a brand has a huge list of customization requests - you can download the Vulcan replica of Membercare & edit it to suit brand’s requirements.

However, if there are very few customization requirements - as of now, we would refrain from using the Vulcan replica of Membercare - owing to a few ongoing internal decisions.

Checkout how you can completely customize a brand’s Membercare experience [here](https://docs.capillarytech.com/reference/customizing-the-member-care-ui).
