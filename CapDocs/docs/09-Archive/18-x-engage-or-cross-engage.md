## Introduction

X-Engage is a message optimization strategy that uses AI to engage customers on channels they mostly respond to. It optimizes your marketing budgets to derive the best ROI (Return on Investment) compared to other strategies. AI engine enhances precision based on customer response during a campaign. It identifies the message hit rate and targets the right customers on their preferred channels. 

Based on a customer's reachability, the X-Engage enables Orgs to engage with customers through multiple channels - direct channels such as SMS, Email, and Mobile Push; ad. channels such as Facebook, Instagram, Google, and YouTube.

For example, suppose a customer has responded mostly to Facebook (ad channel) campaign messages than other channels. In that case, the AI engine targets that customer only through Facebook instead of sending the same message through multiple communication channels.
