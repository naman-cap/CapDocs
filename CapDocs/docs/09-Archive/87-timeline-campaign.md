## Timeline Campaign

Timeline Campaigns help you to add the “time” dimension to your marketing campaigns. Timeline Campaigns help you foresee customers’ needs and engage them with just the right offers and communication. Timeline Campaigns can be triggered on the first transaction, last transaction, or on real-time events.

Using timeline campaigns, you can

Segment customers to trigger personalized engagement models and thus achieve higher response rates  
Enable multiple timelines at any point in time to accommodate for likely changes in customer responses and buying pattern  
Automate offer generation and marketing communication  
Add personal milestones such as customer birthdays/anniversaries  
Timeline Campaigns help you foresee customers’ needs and engage them with just the right offers and communication.
