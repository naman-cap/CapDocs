**1\. Custom Report Archiving: Declutter Your Reports Like a Pro!**

Hey there, report creators! We have a super cool feature to share with you. You can now manually archive your custom reports and keep your report listing page neat and tidy. It's like you've suddenly become a pro-organizer!

**Problem Statement:** 

1. Managing a large number of custom reports can be difficult, leading to clutter and reduced efficiency. 
2. Users need a way to declutter their report listing page and focus on the reports that matter most to them and their brands.

**Overview of the feature:**

The feature allows users to manually archive and unarchive their custom reports, keeping their report listing page organized and reducing the time spent managing reports. Also, Archived reports won't disappear forever. You can access them again by going to the Archived Reports tab. Only custom reports created by you are available to archive. 

**Benefits of this feature include:**

* *Better organization*: Remove the reports you no longer need and stay organized with ease.
* *Increased efficiency*: Spend less time sifting through unnecessary reports and more time on the ones that matter most to you.
* *More control*: You get to decide which reports to keep and which ones to let go of.

**Release Plan:**

The feature is already live across all the orgs. We hope this feature helps you keep your reports in check like a pro! If you have any feedback or questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to the product team.
