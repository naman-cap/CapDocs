# Automated Onboarding of Behavioral Events:

Until recently, new behavioural events required onboarding by the Sustenance team before you could create funnel charts, export data, or build audience groups based on the filters created by an analyst. With this enhancement, behavioural events created in the CDP would be onboarded automatically into the Insights database when the data is pushed into the behavioural event, eliminating the need for the Sustenance team while allowing you to perform the same functions as before.\
For more information, please refer to the documentation [here](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/setup-test-behavioral-events#reporting).

# Reporting on Platform Extensions:

Currently, platform extensions allow you to extend the platformâ€™s capabilities and store additional data. However, until now, reporting on this data through the extensions was not possible.  As a part of this enhancement we have built a functionality that syncs this data with the ETL runs in the Insights Database on a daily basis, enabling comprehensive reporting.\
