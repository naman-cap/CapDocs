# Unified targets

For any brand, cross-selling across verticals, products, and categories is a dream run. This is because, cross-selling means: more sales, an increase in diverse purchases, faster shelf clearance, etc.. 

After this enhancement, from now on, you'll be able to give multiple targets to your users from a single milestone. It's like multiple targets moving parallelly as a bundle, and the user has to achieve the bundle to get the benefits.

To know more in detail: [Unified targets, will be an interesting read](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/unified-milestones), and [API](https://docs.capillarytech.com/reference/create-unified-targets)

# Customer status & label action

If there is any metadata that is of high importance to any brand, it is the "customer status & label". This information helps brands in doing various types of actions (like running promotions, fraud control, etc..) on their customers.

From now on, you'll be having "action" in programs & promotions using which you can simply configure "status & label" for your customers in an extremely simple way. Not only this, you'll be able to write rules based on "status & label" which is a cherry on the top.

# Blockage of points

As of now, whenever a customer label is tagged to "points blockage", the points for the customer are being blocked when allocated using the "transaction point allocation". This could be a challenge as points can be given to customers using other actions also.

After this enhancement, whenever a customer label is tagged to "points blockage", the allocation of points will be blocked from all types of points actions like "target point allocation", "allocation points", etc..
