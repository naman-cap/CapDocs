# Leaderboards for Milestones

A new feature to gamify [milestones](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/milestones-new-flow). Leaderboards provide a high-score list where customers are ranked based on their progress towards a milestone. Brand can enable leaderboards for existing milestones or create new leaderboard-enabled milestones.

To enable leaderboards for a milestone refer to the [leaderboards documentation](https://docs.capillarytech.com/reference/leaderboards).

## APIs for leaderboards

1. **Get top ranked users:** Get a ranked list of users who have achieved a target within a timeframe.
2. **Get user rank across target groups**: Get a userâ€™s rankings in all enrolled targets within a timeframe.

Refer to the documentation on the [get top ranked users](https://docs.capillarytech.com/reference/get-top-ranked-users) API and the [get user rank across target groups](https://docs.capillarytech.com/reference/get-user-ranks-across-target-groups) API.

# User Created Challenges

A new feature for [milestones](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/milestones-new-flow) that lets users create a challenge for themselves and earn rewards for completing them. Existing milestone APIs have been updated to support this feature.
