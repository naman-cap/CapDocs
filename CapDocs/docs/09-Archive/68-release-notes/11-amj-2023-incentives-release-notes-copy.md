# Rewards Catalog

## Enhancements in getUserRewards API for enhanced clarity and user experience

**Changes in Existing API:**

We've heard you! In the past, users couldn't peek at the points spent when purchasing rewards from the rewards catalog. Now, with the new enhancement, we're pulling back the curtain. You and your customers can see the exact number of points spent on each reward. No more mysteries, just clarity.

Refer to the detailed API documentation [here](https://docs.capillarytech.com/reference/get-rewards-for-user).

**Introduction of New API:**

We're rolling out a shiny new API. It's like giving you a fresh pair of glasses to see your rewards even more clearly. Say goodbye to those confusing aggregated views. Now, when you want to check your last 5 purchased rewards, the new API will give you just that - the last 5 vouchers, no extra fluff.

For example, Imagine you have 10 vouchers from one reward and 3 vouchers from another. If you want to see your last 2 purchases, the old API would show you a total of 13 purchases (10 from the first reward and 3 from the second). It's like mixing apples and oranges.

Now, with the new API, it's crystal clear. When you check for your last 2 purchases, you'll only see the most recent 2 vouchers you've received. It's like organizing your closet so you can find your favorite shirt right away.

Refer to the detailed API documentation [here](https://docs.capillarytech.com/reference/get-rewards-for-user-new-api).

<Note title="Note">
There are no changes in response structure of the existing API, we have just built the new API for a more clear view of the rewards purchased by the customer.
</Note>

## Optimize your rewards budget & catalog inventory

With recent changes in reward restrictions, our marketing maestros can now lay down the below laws for their rewards:

üõçÔ∏è Maximum quantities of a reward that a single customer can snag during the reward bonanza.

üéÅ Maximum quantities of a reward that can be snatched up by all your amazing customers combined.

This new update allows for more equal opportunities for customers to avail benefits while also optimizing spending at the reward level.

But wait, there's more! You can tweak these restrictions daily once a reward goes live. That's right, control is now at your fingertips. We've even thrown in the option to input a big fat "0" for those moments when you want things ultra-exclusive enabling specific limitations, exclusions as desired or out of stock scenarios.
