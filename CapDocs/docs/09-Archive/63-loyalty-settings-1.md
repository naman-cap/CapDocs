## Creation/deletion/editing of custom fields.

First of all, what are custom fields?

Custom fields are the fields which won't be available by default to all organisations unlike the standard fields which will be available by default. As they name suggested, they are meant for customisation as per the brand's needs. 

To understand with an example, a field which is very much required for a diamond brand (like Joyalukkas) might not be necessary for an electronics brand (like Croma).

So for Joyalukkas, a custom field (let's say, diameter of the diamond) need to be created for their activities & actions.  These fields are relatively very easy to create, and have 3 primary actions:

1. Creation of custom field
2. Editing the custom field
3. Deleting the custom field

Following media helps in understanding how to do that:
