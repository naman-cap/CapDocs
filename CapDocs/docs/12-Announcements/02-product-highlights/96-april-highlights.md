### Capillary’s Subscription-based loyalty

#### Driving CLTV with subscription-based incentives

Hi Shalu,

Subscription-based loyalty has helped brands dramatically improve their most relevant metrics like brand affinity and customer lifetime value. While on the surface it may seem like a normal loyalty program with a fee, it’s so much more powerful than that in effect. In this mail, we’re going deeper into how brands can start leveraging subscription-based loyalty to their advantage.

**Why should brands introduce subscription-based loyalty?**

Some of a brand’s most loyal customers often find themselves coming back to the brand in regular intervals. When such customers aren’t identified and acknowledged, it’s a huge miss for the brands – since their purchase revenue isn’t booked until the actual purchase, there is a greater variable in revenue generation.

59% shoppers are more likely to choose a brand they've subscribed to over competitors

62% shoppers are likely to spend more on a brand they've subscribed to

Subscription Loyalty can help brands elevate the overall consumer experience, deliver high-value rewards and build rewarding relationships with their most regular customers. by acknowledging and rewarding them through a subscription program.
