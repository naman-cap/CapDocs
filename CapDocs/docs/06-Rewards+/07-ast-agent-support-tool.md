The Agent Support Tool (AST) is a web-based application designed to streamline customer service operations for Reward+ clients. It serves as a centralized platform for managing membership data, service requests (SRs), and customer interactions across various business lines, including banking, insurance, and loyalty programs. It also maintains an audit trail of all customer interactions, improving transparency and compliance.

On the backend, AST pulls data from the same sources as Rewards+â€”such as the Data Lake, Member DB, Offer DB, and Claims DB. It is powered by the same APIs and services, ensuring data consistency and alignment across both systems.

**Key Features**

* **Membership Management**: Rewards+ support agents can access member profiles and transactions across all Rewards clients. They can search for and view customer profiles, including subscription details, benefits, and service history.
* **Service Request (SR) Tracking**: Log, monitor, and resolve customer queries, complaints, and requests efficiently.
* **Multi-Channel Support**: Handle phone, email, and system-generated requests in one unified interface.\
  \*\*Automated Workflows: \*\*Predefined SR types for common scenarios (e.g., event bookings, cinema eCodes, complaints).
* **Extract Scheduling & Monitoring:** Supports creation and scheduling of extracts directly from within the AST application, enabling agents to monitor and track SLA performance for various SRs.
* **Goodwill Offers:** Supports issuance of 'Goodwill Offers' to address unhappy customers. Once activated, these offers are added to the customer's profile and can be redeemed like any standard offer.
