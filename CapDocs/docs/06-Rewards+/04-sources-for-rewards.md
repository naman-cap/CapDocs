# Event vendors

Rewards+ partners with See Tickets, ATG, Trafalgar, and Ticketmaster to offer tickets for concerts, sports events, theatre, and live shows. These offers are often discounted and may include additional cashback rewards.

# Cinema vendors

Rewards+ sources discounted movie tickets and e-vouchers through cinema vendors like Spark and The Cinema Society. These can be redeemed online or at participating theatres.

# Cashback aggregators

Rewards+ integrates with platforms like Finfare, which connect with multiple retailers to offer cashback on purchases. These aggregators track purchases and enable cashback rewards for end users.

# Voucher aggregators

Voucher platforms like Finfare provide Rewards+ with a consolidated catalog of digital vouchers, such as gift cards, coupons, or discount codes, sourced from various businesses.

# Direct merchant vouchers

Rewards+ also includes vouchers issued directly by merchants. These are managed through direct relationships between the brand and the merchant, without involving third-party aggregators.

# Gift card vendors

Vendors like Neo Currency supply Rewards+ with a wide selection of digital gift cards across categories such as retail, food, entertainment, and travel.

# Travel vendors

Providers like Leisure Loyalty offer white-label travel portals and curated travel deals. These travel rewards can be added to a brandâ€™s loyalty offering through Rewards+.

# Card-linked offers (CLOs)

Rewards+ supports CLOs via vendors like Fidel. Users link their payment cards, and eligible rewards are automatically applied when they shop at participating merchants.

# Client partner offers

Clients can upload and distribute offers shared by their strategic partners. These offers are typically tied to co-branded initiatives or partnership arrangements.

# Client-sourced cashback and vouchers

Clients can create, fund, and manage their own cashback and voucher-based rewards directly in Rewards+. These are separate from aggregator-managed catalogs and are fully controlled by the client.
