# Merchant cashback

A merchant cashback is a promotional offer funded by brands, where customers receive a percentage of their purchase amount back typically as wallet credit or account credit. Although the merchant facilitates the sale, the reward is issued by the brand to encourage repeat purchases and build customer loyalty.

# Merchant vouchers

Merchant vouchers are discount codes or offers funded by brands to drive purchases from specific merchants. These vouchers can provide price discounts, free products, or partial payments, and are redeemed at merchant outlets or platforms.

# Cashback or discount on event booking

These offers are funded by brands or partner platforms (such as event portals or credit card companies) to encourage ticket purchases for events like movies, concerts, plays, or workshops. Customers receive savings through instant discounts or cashback.

# Cashback or discount on cinema and film rentals

This reward type applies when customers book movie tickets or rent films. Cashback or discounts are typically offered by brands in collaboration with cinema platforms or streaming partners, often via promo codes or eligible payment modes.

# Cashback or discount on travel booking

These offers allow customers to receive money back or reduced prices when booking flights, hotels, or travel packages. Funded by brands or travel partners, the rewards help increase conversions on travel-related purchases.

# Card-linked cashback offers

In this model, customers earn cashback automatically when they use a linked debit or credit card at participating merchant outlets. The cashback is funded by brands and credited after eligible transactions, with no need for vouchers or manual claims.
