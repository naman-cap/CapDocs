# Overview

A brand may need to customise Member Care to fit their specific requirements. Vulcan enables the building of UI customisations and enable these apps as Member Care overrides specific to the organization. 

Customising the UI allows brands to see their version instead of the standard Capillary application.

# Prerequisites

To get started ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

*   [VULCAN SUPERADMIN](https://docs.capillarytech.com/reference/vulcan-getting-started#access-roles) access
*   Node.js 14.21.3 (preferrably using [nvm](https://dev.to/csituma/install-nvm-on-mac-windows-and-linux-1aj9)).\
  You can install the specific node.js version using the following command:
  ```
  nvm install 14.21.3
  ```
*   Member Care UI replica [template](https://github.com/Capillary/cap-member-care-vulcan-replica) . For access, raise a JIRA request to the Capillary UI team.
*   Pre-built Vulcan application
*   Application configuration file

The following procedure outlines how to set up the Vulcan application and create a Member Care UI replica :

1. ### [Set up the Vulcan application](https://docs.capillarytech.com/reference/vulcan-getting-started#application-setup).
   1. Access the Vulcan UI.
   2. Create the application on Vulcan UI.
   3. Enter the [basic details ](https://docs.capillarytech.com/reference/vulcan-getting-started#basic-details)and [internationalization details ](https://docs.capillarytech.com/reference/vulcan-getting-started#internationalization-details)(if required) for the application.\
         <br />
      > ❗️ Important:
      >
      > For customised member care overrides, create your app name in the given format:\
      > `member-care-ui-<orgID>`.
      >
      > Example:\
      > If your Organization ID is "1231", the application name should be in the following format:\
      > `member-care-ui-1231`
2. ### Download the App Configuration
