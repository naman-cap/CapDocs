#### Types of Vulcan applications

There are three types of applications available on Vulcan:

| Type          | Description                                                                   |
| :------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Global        | Accessible to all organisations and clusters, and not editable once created.  |
| Native        | Accessible to a specific organisation and shareable with other organisations. |
| External Apps | Not currently supported.                                                      |

<Note title="Note">
s
* Creating global applications requires Capillary Organization access and Vulcan ADMIN permissions.
* Native and external applications can be edited or deleted by users with Vulcan ADMIN access.
* Global and native apps are embedded in Member Care, they use InTouch authentication by default  and do not require additional authentication.
</Note>

### Internationalisation Details

The internationalisation (I18n) setup in Vulcan allows developers to configure applications to support multiple languages and regional settings.

<Note title="Note">
Vulcan provides built-in support for InTouch (Locize) or the option to implement a custom API-based solution for internationalization.
</Note>

To enable internationalisation for your application, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Internationalisation Details** section.
2. Choose **Yes** under Enable I18n.
3. Choose the I18n Type.

<Note title="Note">
The types are as follows:

**InTouch:** Through Locize\
**Custom:** External I18n provider or API
</Note>

4. Enter the details for internationalisation.

<Note title="Note">
You can find your Locize Project Id and Project Key in your projects settings under your Locize account.

To get started and configure Locize, refer to the Locize developer documentation.
</Note>

5. Click on **Test** to validate the details.
6. Click **Create Application** to register the app on the Vulcan platform.

The details of each field are as follows:

| **Field**               | **Description**                                                                                              |
| :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Locize Project Name** | The name of your translation project in Locize, used to organise translation resources for your application. |
| **Locize Project ID**   | A unique identifier for your Locize project, ensuring your app pulls the correct translations.               |
| **Locize Project Key**  | A unique key provided by Locize, used to authenticate and access your specific translation project.          |
| **Test Locale**         | The locale code (en-US, fr-FR) is used for testing your app's internationalisation setup.                    |

<Note title="Note">
To manually setup internationalization during application development refer to the [Setting Up Internationalization During Development](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/vulcan-application-development#setting-up-internationalization-during-development) section.
</Note>

### **RBAC Details**

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) allows you to configure and whitelist Vulcan APIs used within a microsite, ensuring secure and structured access. When RBAC is enabled for a Vulcan application, API access is restricted by app ID, and only users with the required permissions (through a membership group or permission set) can access and execute the whitelisted Vulcan APIs. When RBAC is disabled for an application, all Vulcan APIs are accessible to all users. Refer to the documentation on [Managing User Permissions](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/managing-permissions) for more information on managing permissions.

<Note title="Note">
This feature is supported for native Vulcan applications only. Refer to the documentation for more information on the [types of Vulcan applications](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/vulcan-getting-started#types-of-vulcan-applications).
</Note>

#### **Key Features of RBAC for Vulcan**

1. **Enhanced Security**: RBAC ensures that only the necessary APIs are accessible to users, restricting unauthorised API calls and defining clear access scopes to improve application security.
2. **Permission Enforcement**: API access is controlled by assigned RBAC permissions. If a user lacks the required permissions, they cannot access or execute the API.

> 🚧 Note:
>
> During [application development](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/application-development-process), it is recommended to disable RBAC initially, complete the UI implementation, and then enable RBAC to whitelist the required APIs.

To enable RBAC for a Vulcan microsite, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **RBAC Details** section.
2. Enable RBAC by selecting **Yes** under **Enable RBAC**.
3. Map a permission to the Vulcan API call by selecting the appropriate permission in the **Permission** drop-down and mapping it to the corresponding Vulcan API endpoint. Permissions define specific actions a user can perform within the system. For example, the `VULCAN_DELETE_APPLICATION` permission allows a user to delete a Vulcan application on the Vulcan UI.

   > 📘 Note:
   >
   > Creating an individual permission is currently unsupported. You can only choose from the list of existing permissions available on the Capillary platform.

![2e8bec66af8c82d549408030639325231e0f20b0fe6930cf97995288f39a2115 image](https://files.readme.io/2e8bec66af8c82d549408030639325231e0f20b0fe6930cf97995288f39a2115-image.png)

The required fields are as follows:

| Field Name  | Description                                                                                                          |
| :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Permission  | Permission to map to the Vulcan API.                                                                                 |
| Method      | Type of API call.                                                                                                    |
| URL         | Endpoint of the Vulcan API. You can find the list of URLs to whitelist from the `api.js` file in the project folder. |
| Description | Description for the API-permission map.                                                                              |

4. In the user management UI, create a permission set with the mapped permissions and assign it to a user. Refer to the documentation for more information on [creating a permission set](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/custom-permission-sets#creating-a-custom-permission-set) and [assigning a permission set to a user](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/assigning-permission-set-to-users).

RBAC for the Vulcan application has been successfully created. If a user has the required permissions, they can access and use the whitelisted APIs.

## Local Project Initialisation

Once you have created an application in the Vulcan UI, you can start initialising the project on your local machine.

1. In a new terminal window, run the following command and press Enter on the keyboard. Use the same application name as provided during the application creation.

```shell
sh create-vulcan-app.sh <app-name>
```

<Note title="Note">
The [create-vulcan-app](https://storage.crm.n.content-cdn.io/create-vulcan-app.sh) is a required setup script. Ensure you have appropriate system permissions to run the script.
</Note>

2. Provide the npm token (required to pull Capillary-specific modules from the NPM registry) and press Enter on the keyboard.
3. Enter the required details: name, email ID, project description, repository type, and repository URL.
