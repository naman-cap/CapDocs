<Note title="Note">
API responses may return combined error codes, which include both an internal error code and an HTTP status code.

For example an error code `600412` would mean:

600: Internal error code.\
412: HTTP status code.

Refer to the [HTTP status code list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) for more information.
