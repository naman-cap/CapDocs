Platform metrics is a key feature of the Dev Console that enhances observability and simplifies debugging for platforms such as Neo, Extensions, and Vulcan. It serves as a central hub for monitoring performance, identifying issues, and streamlining troubleshooting. Furthermore, it enables you to analyze API behaviors and performance trends.

The Platform Metrics consists of a dashboard which caters to different applications or extensions. The **Platform Metrics** dashboard gives a high-level overview of all metrics.

# Accessing Platform Metrics

To access Platform Metrics, 

Navigate to the **Logs and Metrics** > **Platform Metrics** from the left pane of the Dev Console.

The following image shows the Platform Metrics page.

# Drill-Down Flow for Debugging

Each dashboard has different sections that display various metrics to help with debugging. **Platform Metrics** follows a four-step drill-down process. Below are the drill-down sections and their fields for the **Neo Platforms** product.

## Creating a Custom Dashboard

Creating a custom dashboard is a simple process that requires minimal manual UI development. Follow these steps to set up a dashboard:

1. Identify the data requirements for your desired dashboard. Ensure the necessary metrics are available.
2. Define the dashboard layout and arrange the charts to present information.
3. Determine how many charts your dashboard needs and assign a unique ID to each one.
4. Define the configuration for each chart in a JavaScript array. Specify the following:
   * Chart ID – Assign a unique identifier to the chart.
   * Data Mapping – Link the chart ID to a query in your database. Use dynamic variables (e.g., order IDs, app names) to make the query adaptable.
   * Display Name – Set the header that appears on the dashboard.
   * Chart Type – Choose from scalar, table, line chart, or area chart. Each chart supports only one type.
   * (Optional) Metadata & Customization (Optional) – Configure additional properties:
     * Format timestamps.
     * Convert large numbers into readable formats.
     * Enable pagination for tables with large datasets.
5. (Optional) Enable filters to let users refine the displayed data. Configure the filter parameters and ensure a query fetches filter options dynamically.
6. Call the `initializeDashboard` function in your code and pass the chart and filter configurations.
7. The dashboard automatically generates and displays the charts based on your configurations. You don’t need to make manual XML or CSS changes.

## Using Dashboard Filters

Dashboard filters let users refine the displayed data based on specific criteria. Filters improve data analysis by allowing users to focus on relevant subsets without modifying queries or configurations manually.

### Key Features

* **Optional Configuration** - Filters are not mandatory for every dashboard. Dashboard creators decide whether to enable them based on the dashboard’s requirements.
* **Configurable Availability** - Filters appear only if configured. Dashboard designers specify whether to include filters and which data attributes they apply to.
* **Dynamic Filter Options** - Filter options update dynamically based on real-time data queries. This ensures you always have relevant filtering options instead of predefined, static lists.
* **Filtering Purpose** - Filters help you refine displayed data, making it easier to analyze specific metrics.\
  For example, you can filter by API endpoint to focus on a specific service's performance.
* **Filter Parameter Configuration** - During dashboard creation, developers specify which columns or parameters you can filter.
* **Query-Based Filtering** - Each filter runs a database query to fetch available options. This keeps the filter selections accurate and up to date.
* **User-Friendly Interaction** - Once configured, filters appear as dropdown menus or selection boxes. You can select filter values, and the dashboard updates automatically to display relevant data.

### How to Use Dashboard Filters

1. If enabled, a filter section appears on the dashboard.
2. Select the desired parameter or column to filter by.
3. Choose a value from the dynamically loaded filter options. For example: a specific API endpoint.
