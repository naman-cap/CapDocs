The Dev Console provides observability, system monitoring, and configuration management for teams working on dataflows and classic extensions. It simplifies development, troubleshooting, and debugging processes.

# Accessing Dev Console

To access Dev Console,

1. Open the link, `https://{host_name}/devconsole.`

2. Use your InTouch login credentials to access the console.

3. From the dropdown in the top-right corner, choose the organization whose configurations you want to manage.

**Note**: In the Dev Console, you can access all the organizations available to you in InTouch.

## Authentication

The Dev Console uses InTouch portal authentication to manage access. It automatically syncs your login status and organization selection with InTouch. When you log out or switch organizations in InTouch, the Dev Console updates instantly.

Hereâ€™s how authentication works in the Dev Console:

* When you log into the InTouch portal in one browser tab, the Dev Console will automatically log you in when you open it in a different tab.
* The Dev Console always connects to the same organization as the InTouch portal.
* When you log out of the InTouch portal, the Dev Console will automatically log you out.
* You can't log in to the Dev Console directly. You must first log in to the InTouch portal.
* When you switch organizations in the InTouch portal, the Dev Console automatically updates to reflect the selected organization.

# Role-Based Access Control

Access to features is provided based on the individual's role. To request access, raise a ticket with the Capillary Product Support team. For information on different types of access, refer to the [User Management documentation](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/list-of-standard-permission-sets#dev-console).

## Simplified Access Permissions

Access control within the Dev Console is managed by Intouch, so there is no need to maintain separate credentials.
