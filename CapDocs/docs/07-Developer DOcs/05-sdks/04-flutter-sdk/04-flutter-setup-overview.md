1. Get the SDK initialization result in the`onHydraSdkInitializationResult({required bool success, String? error})` callback provided by the handler.
2. Use the HydraCore class for user management. It includes static functions such as: [signUp](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/flutter-sdk-api-reference#signup), [signIn](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/flutter-sdk-api-reference#sign-in), [updateUser](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/flutter-sdk-api-reference#update-user), [signOut](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/flutter-sdk-api-reference#sign-out), [updateGeoConfig](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/flutter-sdk-api-reference#update-geo-config), [updatePushPreferences](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/flutter-sdk-api-reference#update-user-push-preferences), and [reportUserEvent](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/flutter-sdk-api-reference#report-custom-user-events).
3. These functions accept a [HydraUserDetails](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/flutter-sdk-api-reference#hydrauserdetails) instance, which requires a customerId that must match the configuration on the Capillary CRM dashboard. Use the [signUp](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/flutter-sdk-api-reference#signup) function to register the user. For subsequent launches, use [signIn](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/flutter-sdk-api-reference#sign-in).
4. The [HydraPushNotification](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/flutter-sdk-api-reference#hydrapushnotification) class provides static functions for push notifications: [requestPermission](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/flutter-sdk-api-reference#request-permission-for-push-notifications) and [getFCMToken](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/flutter-sdk-api-reference#get-fcm-token). To receive push notifications, you can ask for permission using [requestPermission](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/flutter-sdk-api-reference#request-permission-for-push-notifications).
5. Use [getFCMToken](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/flutter-sdk-api-reference#get-fcm-token) to get the FCM token. If you added an event handler in step 1, you also receive the callback in [onTokenAvailable](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/flutter-sdk-api-reference#hydranativeeventhandler-class).
6. Use the [HydraInbox](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/flutter-sdk-api-reference#hydrainbox) class to manage them with functions like [getInboxMessages](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/flutter-sdk-api-reference#get-list-of-hydra-notifications), [getUnreadInboxMessagesCount](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/flutter-sdk-api-reference#get-unread-hydra-notifications-count), [markInboxMessageAsRead](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/flutter-sdk-api-reference#mark-a-hydra-notification-as-read), [deleteInboxMessage](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/flutter-sdk-api-reference#delete-a-hydra-notification), and [deleteAllInboxMessages](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/flutter-sdk-api-reference#delete-all-hydra-notifications). The Hydra SDK saves notifications in a database.
7. Use the [HydraInboxUI](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/flutter-sdk-api-reference#hydrainboxui) class functions: [showNotificationCenter](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/flutter-sdk-api-reference#show-in-built-notification-center) and [hideNotificationCenterIfShowing](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/flutter-sdk-api-reference#hide-in-built-notification-center-if-showing) to use the built-in notification center from the Hydra plugin.
8. Set the console log level in hydra-config.json. It should be an integer from 0 to 5, where 0 represents off, 1 for error, 2 for warning, 3 for info, 4 for debug, and 5 for verbose. You can also set one of these log levels for remote logging using hydra\_remote\_log\_level in Firebase Remote Configuration.

The [HydraNativeEventHandler](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/flutter-sdk-api-reference#hydranativeevent-class-apis) also includes callbacks for [onHydraNotificationReceived](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/flutter-sdk-api-reference#onhydranotificationreceived), [onHydraNotificationClicked](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/flutter-sdk-api-reference#onhydranotificationclicked), [onHydraNotificationDismissed](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/flutter-sdk-api-reference#onhydranotificationdismissed), [onHydraNotificationShown](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/flutter-sdk-api-reference#onhydranotificationshown), and [onNotificationCenterDismissed](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/flutter-sdk-api-reference#onnotificationcenterdismissed).
