This document provides a clear, concise mapping of Capillary's database structure to support the rapid creation of gRPC‑based data access APIs. The relationships between physical databases, logical databases, and individual tables—including key indexed fields—enable AI‑powered tools to generate precise SQL queries on demand.

**Purpose**

* Enable API architects, integration engineers, and AI models to discover where data resides
* Eliminate manual schema exploration when exposing data via gRPC APIs
