# Versioning and Checkpoints

* When you accept a modified dataflow and send it for approval, it is saved as a new version.
* You can revert to a previous version if needed.
* Modifications build upon the latest accepted version.

# Error Handling

* A common error block is added by default.
* You can prompt the AI to create block-specific error handlers.
* Manual edits are supported for URL blocks and specific parameters.
