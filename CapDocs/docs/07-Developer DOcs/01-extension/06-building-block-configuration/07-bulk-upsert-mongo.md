The Bulk Upsert Mongo block enables bulk upsert operations in MongoDB. Upsert is a database operation that combines update and insert actions, allowing new data to be inserted while updating existing records in bulk. Use this block when handling more than ten queries simultaneously.

# Example Scenario

**Requirement**

A retail company tracks customers who achieve a specific target within a given timeframe. These customers qualify for rewards as part of the company's loyalty management program, which Capillary handles. The data is exported from the company's database as a CSV file and sent to the Capillary system. If a record exists, Capillary must update the record available in the Capillary database; otherwise, the system should create a new record.

**Solution**

To insert and update a large amount of data in MongoDB, create a dataflow using the Bulk Upsert Mongo block. This block updates existing data and inserts new data if it is missing in the specified collection.

Refer to this example [dataflow](https://eu.intouch.capillarytech.com/extensions/neo/ui/rule/ee1d88a8-6a2f-4392-b320-7097b82de6b6/version/78c97c99-98e4-48e6-b6f4-ed15fa7e5397?ruleType=org) to understand how it is configured for a use case.\
Make sure you have access to DocDemo org (100737) and [access to Neo](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/access-management-neo#enabling-neo-extension-access--user-roles).

# Configuring the Bulk Upsert Mongo Block

To configure the Bulk Upsert Mongo block,

1. From the dataflow canvas, click on the node and select the **Bulk Upsert Mongo** block.
2. In the **Block Name**, enter the name of the block.\
   **Note**: Block names cannot contain spaces or special characters, except for underscores (\_). Use camelCase or snake\_case formatting.
3. In the **Collection Name** field, enter the collection name to be updated.
4. In the **Mode** field, choose the mode of the update as `bulkupsert`.
5. In the **Query** field, enter the data to ingest into MongoDB.

<Note title="Note">
s
* Both a filter and a query are mandatory in each object.
* Each object contains:
  * Selection filter – Finds specific records in the database.
  * Query – Defines how the record should be updated.
* DAO methods interact with the database and execute queries.
* Expression handling enables dynamic query generation, allowing logic or conditions to modify queries before execution.
* If the filter or query is missing, the operation fails due to an invalid input query.\
  Below is the code from the Script block

```json Code in the Script block
const requestBodyArray = getApiRequest().body;

        const bulkOps = [];

        for (const record of requestBodyArray) {
            const { userGroupId, targetGroupId, targetRuleId, progressSumAmt, progressAvgAmt } = record;

            // Create the filter using the composite primary key
            const filter = {
                userGroupId,
                targetGroupId,
                targetRuleId
            };

            const upsertData = {
                filter: JSON.stringify(filter),
                query: JSON.stringify({ $set: { progressSumAmt, progressAvgAmt } }),
                upsert: true
            };
            bulkOps.push(upsertData);
        }


        return {
            data: bulkOps
        };
```
</Note>

6. (Optional) In the **Options** field, specify any additional options for the query. These options modify query behavior and how results are returned.\
   **Note**: Refer to [MongoDB documentation on options](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.update/) for information on **Options**.
7. Configure the [input execution logic](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/configuring-conditions), [cachable feature](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/configuring-caching), and [define the execution path](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/configuring-relations) as per the requirement.
8. Click **Done**.
