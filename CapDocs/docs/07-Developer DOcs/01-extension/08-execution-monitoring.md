# Execution of a Dataflow

After creating a dataflow, you can integrate it into applications. You can also import it to any API testing tool and execute or test it.

## Copying a Dataflow cURL

To copy the dataflow cURL,

1. **Identify the Dataflow Scope:**\
   Go to the **Dataflows** page and select the tab based on the dataflow’s scope:

   * **My Dataflows** → For dataflows within your organization.

   * **Global Dataflows** → For dataflows at the global level.

2. **Select the Dataflow:**  

* Click the dataflow you want to execute.

* Choose the version you want to run.

3. **Copy the cURL:**\
   On the dataflow composition page, hover over **Copy curl** and click to copy the required cURL.

   * B2B cURL → Use this when one system interacts with another (business to business).
   * B2C cURL → Use this for customer-facing interactions where the system communicates directly with end users.

   > 📘 Note
   >
   > * B2B cURL: Uses OAuth or Basic authorization.  
   > * B2C cURL: Uses mobile OTPs or social logins for authorization.

## Executing a Cross-Organizational Dataflow

 Cross-organizational dataflows allow execution across different organizations.

### Execution Scope

* **Global Dataflows:** Defined at the global organization level and accessible to all organizations.  
* **Parent Dataflows:** Defined in a parent organization and accessible to both self and its child organizations. Applicable for Connected Organizations.  
* **Organization Dataflows**: Defined in your organization and available only for your organization.

<Note title="Note">
* Global dataflows execute within the context of the calling organization, even though they are globally defined.
* Context Switching: Execution can switch from a parent organization to its child organization using a "context switch" block. However, execution cannot switch from a child organization to its parent.
* A parent organization cannot execute a dataflow from a child organization.
</Note>

### Testing a Cross-Organizational Dataflow

1. [Copy the dataflow cURL](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/execution-monitoring#copying-a-dataflow-curl).

2. Import the cURL Command into an API testing tool.  

3. Set the `x-cap-neo-dag-scope` Header.

   * `global`: Executes a dataflow from the global organization.  
   * `parent`: Executes a dataflow from the parent organization.  
   * `org`: Executes a dataflow from your organization.  

4. Enter Body Parameters

   * For `POST` and `PUT` methods, provide the necessary request body parameters.  

5. Execute the Dataflow

   * Run the cURL command from the API testing tool.

# Observibility & Monitoring

You can view and analyze the performance of your Neo API, the APIs used in the Neo dataflow, view the logs, etc, using the [Dev Console](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/dev-console). The Dev Console helps in the monitoring and debugging process for the dataflow.
