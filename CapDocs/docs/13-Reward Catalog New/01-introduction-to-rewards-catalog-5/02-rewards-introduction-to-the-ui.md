The UI landing page includes the following: Search Bar, Status Bar, Activation Status, Advanced Filters, and Rewards Catalog Display. Each section is as follows:

## Search Bar:

The search bar helps find any rewards that have been created within the organization. Enter relevant keywords to find specific rewards or search by reward name.

## Status Bar:

The status bar provides filtering options based on the reward lifecycle. It includes three categories:

| Upcoming                                                 | Live                                                                  | Ended                                                              |
| :------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lists rewards that are scheduled to start in the future. | Lists rewards that are currently active and available for redemption. | Lists rewards that have already expired or reached their end date. |

## Activation Status:

This filter helps sort rewards based on whether they are currently enabled or disabled within the system. It includes two options:

| Active                                                          | Inactive                                     |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| Lists rewards that are currently in use and available to users. | Lists rewards that are not currently active. |

## Advanced filters:

The advanced filter section allows you to refine your search and view specific rewards based on additional criteria. It includes the following options:

| Duration                                        | Reward Type                                     | Reward Vendor                                                        |
