Groups help brands organize rewards into clear sections based on their type, purpose, or theme. This makes the catalog easier to browse and helps customers find what theyâ€™re looking for. Brands can create groups like Featured Rewards, Exclusive Offers, or Seasonal Rewards, and can also add a reward to more than one group if needed. This keeps the catalog well-organized and improves the overall customer experience.

## Creating a Reward Group

1. Navigate to the **Reward Category portal** > **Settings** > **Create Group.**
2. Select on  the **"Create Group"** field.
3. Enter the name of the group in the Name field. This field is required.
4. Enter a rank for the group in the Rank field(Optional). This is used to order or prioritize groups.
5. Select **"Save"** to create the group, or **"Cancel"** to discard the action.

## Editing a Reward Group:

1. Locate the group you want to edit from the list.
2. Select the **Edit** button next to the group name.
3. In the **Edit Group** popup, update the Name field as needed.
4. Optionally, update the **Rank** field if required.
5. Select **Save** to apply the changes.
6. To cancel without saving, select **Cancel**.
