Custom fields allow brands to add extra information to their rewards. These fields support different data types, including string, integer, date, and boolean. Each custom field comes with attributes such as name, description, data type, default value, and whether it is mandatory. By using custom fields, brands can better align the rewards catalog with their specific business needs. For example, a Boolean custom field could indicate whether the customer has requested gift wrapping for their reward or for physical rewards, a custom field could capture the customer's shipping address.
