Redemption limits allow brands to control how rewards are redeemed by customers. These limits help manage inventory, control budgets, and ensure fair access to rewards. Brands can set restrictions at different levels. At the customer level, they can limit how many times a customer can redeem a specific reward per day, week, month, or over the entire reward period. At the reward level, they can set a cap on how many times a reward can be redeemed in total across all customers. Additionally, brands can limit the number of points a customer can use, either across the full catalog or for specific redemption types, programs, or tiers. For example, a coffee shop may set limits on its Free Coffee reward to manage redemptions. Each customer can redeem the reward up to two times per week, and only one reward can be used per transaction. The reward is also limited to a total of 500 redemptions across all customers. These limits help the brand control usage, manage inventory, and ensure the reward is available to more customers.
