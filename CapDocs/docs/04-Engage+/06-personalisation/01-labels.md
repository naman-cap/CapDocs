Labels are dynamic tags used to personalize the message content used in the respective communication channel. These tags allow you to insert specific information, such as a recipient's name, store name, or other relevant details, into the message. For example, you might use a label like `{{first_name}}` to include the recipient's name in each message.

## Coupon start and end date

Coupons or offers have varying start and end dates for each customer based on their interactions with the brand. To provide information to customers regarding their offers' start and end dates, you can use these tags and send communications.

**Example:** Consider two users: David and Roy. David receives an offer assigned on January 1st, with redemption starting on January 7th and ending on January 10th. Roy, on the other hand, is assigned an offer on January 11th, with start and end dates of January 17th and January 20th, respectively. If you want to send an SMS to remind them about their coupons' validity periods, you can use the coupon expiry and coupon start date tags in the message content.

## Entry event

You can use the entry event label (dynamic tag) in a journey to include the values associated with the user's entry event in your communication message. The available tags depend on the entry trigger. For example, if the user entry event is based on a promotion, you can include details such as the promotion name or promotion start date in the message. To add this, select the Entry Event option from the drop-down menu and choose the appropriate label tag.

If the entry event is changed after using the entry event label, a warning message is displayed. If the warning is ignored, the labels will fail to function correctly.
