> Recurring Campaign can be created from the new UI only.

To create a recurring campaign, perform the following:

# Step 1. Create Audience filter

* Navigate to the **Audience** page and <Anchor label="create an audience group using the Import via FTP Connector" target="_blank" href="https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/create-audience-group#/create-audience-group-using-import-via-ftp-connector-option">create an audience group using the Import via FTP Connector</Anchor> option.
* Save and share the name with the user who adds the file to the FTP. The file name should match the CSV file name in the FTP location.

# Step 2. Create Connect+ dataflow

* Navigate to Connect+ and create a Connect+ template using the [Audience Reload from FTP template](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/audience-reload-from-ftp).
* Engage updates the audience group within 15 minutes after the Connect+ dataflow runs.

# Step 3. Create campaign

* Navigate to Engage and create a Broadcast Campaign.
* Select the audience group created for this recurring campaign.
* In the **Schedule** option, select **Repeat Periodically**. Define the following:
  * Campaign repeat schedule
  * Duration of recurring campaign message
  * Time to send the message. Schedule the message for at least four hours after the Connect+ dataflow updates the audience group.
  > üìò Note
  >
  > In cases where data sync is delayed or faces issues you can adjust the campaign start time accordingly. For example, if sync completes by 10:30 AM, scheduling the campaign at 10:30 AM instead of 10:00 AM will ensure accurate audience targeting. To enable this feature raise a JIRA ticket to the Product Support Team.

For more information refer to [schedule message](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/schedule-message#repeats-periodically) documentation.

# Step 4. Monitor and troubleshoot

* **Data flow logs:** check processed count and errors.
* **Campaign dashboard:** verify send counts and engagement.
* For FTP issues, review the **error** folder.
* If you see ‚ÄúWaiting for file,‚Äù confirm the file name and path.

<Note title="Note">
If the audience list on a particular day is the same as the previous day, the campaign execution is automatically skipped for that day and will be notified via alert.

For example, if user IDs 1 to 100 are targeted on Day 1 and the same user IDs are included again on Day 2 (whether through**audience filters** or **FTP**uploads), the system will skip execution on Day 2 to avoid duplication.

On Day 3, if a new user base is detected, the campaign will run automatically. No manual action is required from the Customer Success Manager (CSM) or any user.
</Note>

### Best practices

* Always use matching names for filters, files, data flows, and campaigns.
* Build in a buffer (e.g., upload file 4 hours before campaign runtime).
* Test with a small CSV of known user IDs before full launch.
* Document all credentials and paths in a shared, secure location.
