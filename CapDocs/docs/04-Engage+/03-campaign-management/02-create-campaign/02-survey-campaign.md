> Survey Campaign can be created from the old UI only.

You can survey your customers by creating a set of questions and sending the link through SMS or Email. Survey Campaigns help you identify the promoters (who are happy with the service and products offered by your organization and likely to refer your brand to their friends) and detractors (those who are not likely to refer your brand) in your customer base.

## Creating a new survey campaign

1. On the InTouch portal, select **Home**from the left-hand corner.

2. Select **Engage+** from the sidebar menu.
