Cart Promotion also called as promotion or promo engine is a type of promotion or discount that helps brands create promotions focused on products in the shopping cart of the customer. Unlike traditional Point-of-Sale (PoS) promotions, which are mainly designed to boost sales, these promotions are event-driven, rule-based, and offer instant gratification during product search or checkout. They are applied on a running campaign to engage customers and build relationships, not just drive transactions.
