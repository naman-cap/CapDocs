The test/preview flow within the campaign framework allows users to validate campaign configuration and message delivery before launching the campaign to a live audience. This helps in ensuring correctness of audience targeting, content, and scheduling.

With this feature, you can configure the campaign for a set of test customers and trigger test sends to observe how messages will be delivered. You can review the entire campaign experience end-to-end, including message appearance and personalization.

# Prerequisite

To test a campaign, test customers should be added. Campaign previews and test sends will be delivered only to these defined test customers. Any campaign sent in test mode will apply only to this group.

## Adding test customers

To add test customers, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the Campaigns page.
2. Create a **new campaign** or select an existing one from the campaign list.
