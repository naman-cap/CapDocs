A campaign in Engage+ is a communication or promotional message sent to a specific group of customers to achieve a business objective such as increasing sales or re-engaging inactive users. Campaigns typically involve sending targeted messages or offers to prompt customers to take specific actions, like visiting a store, making a purchase, or referring a friend.

# Types of campaign

You can create a campaign for different marketing objectives, such as Sales promotion, New Store openings, Brand anniversaries, Birthdays, and many others. There are 6 types of campaigns.

1. **[Referral Campaign](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/referral-campaign)**- Referral campaigns help you acquire new customers by using your existing customers networks. Existing customers can refer their friends and contacts to visit your store. You can configure your referral campaigns to reward both the referrer (the existing customers who provide their friends email addresses or phone numbers) and the referee (the friends of existing customers who receive the invitation) when the referee enrols in your loyalty program or make transactions.
2. **[Survey campaign](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/survey-campaign)**- Survey Campaigns help you identify the promoters (who are happy with the service and products offered by your organization and likely to refer your brand to their friends) and detractors (those who are not likely to refer your brand) in your customer base. You can survey your customers by creating a set of questions and sending the link through SMS or Email.
3. **[Bounceback or DVS Campaign](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/bounceback-or-dvs-campaign)**- Bounceback campaigns help issue coupons instantly to customers based on the current purchase or a barcode scan.
4. **[Broadcast Campaign](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/broadcast-campaign)**- Broadcast campaigns are campaigns that are implemented to target a bulk audience. These campaigns' functioning depends on customers' historical data and behaviours. So we can actually launch the campaign by specifying the audience which we want to target for the specific campaign.
5. **[Journey Campaign](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/journey-campaign)**- Journey campaigns are the campaigns that enable you to create scenario-based flows to nurture your customers throughout their lifecycles. It helps marketers identify the right course of action by creating multi-campaign flows, incentivizing customers, and engaging them via multi-channel personalized communication, all in one place.
6. **[Recurring Campaign](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/recurring-campaign)**- Recurring campaigns let you automatically send the same message at defined intervals (daily, weekly, monthly or custom) over a set duration, with audience lists refreshed via FTP/Connect+ dataflows to keep your targeting up to date.
