This feature enables a marketer to bulk upload a list of stores within a condition.\
This is very useful in cases where a brand has a large number of stores registered.\
The feature also helps to:

* Reduce the hassle of manually adding multiple stores within a condition
* Eliminate any errors that can be caused while doing so manually.

# Uploading store csv

While configuring a condition, whenever you select **Current store > Store**,  the application displays a **Choose file** option. To upload a CSV file that includes the list of stores:

1. Click **Choose file**. You can choose a file from your computer and upload it directly onto the condition
