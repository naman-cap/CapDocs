The Journey Block Level Reporting feature provides detailed insights into the performance of individual blocks within a journey. This enhanced reporting capability helps you to understand how each block is performing and enables you to take action if required.

> ðŸš§ Note

> By default, this feature is not available for all the orgs. You need to raise a Jira ticket to the sustenance team to enable the feature for your org.

## Type of KPIs in the report

The application fetches different types of KPIs, depending on the blocks used in the journey:

* Basic channel measures  such as Sent, delivered, clicked and opened (wherever applicable)
* Basic journey measures such as the number of customers who entered a block, number of customers who exited the journey, number of customers waiting in a wait block and so on
* Incentives measures - Issued and Redeemed

A journey report will be available 24 hours after the Journey goes live. This is based on the ETL sync time as it is based on the date from the Insights backend.

4. From the meat-ball menu, click the **Reset to default view** to reset the view.

## Using date filter for report

The date filter allows you to view the report for a desired date range. Below are the features of the date filter:

* The default date range for the report is from the date the journey went live until the current date.
* You can alter the date range for the report by changing the start and end dates.
* When you open the report mode, the application displays relevant data based on the selected version. For instance, if you have two versions of your journey and Version 1 spans from August 2 to August 3, the application will display the report for that specific duration when you open Version 1.
