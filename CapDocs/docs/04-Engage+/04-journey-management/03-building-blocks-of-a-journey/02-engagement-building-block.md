The engagement block contains different types of channels that can be used to engage with your customers. A marketer can add an engagement block (of a particular channel) and configure the content in that block (specific to that channel) to reach out to users.

The various engagement blocks available are:

1. SMS
2. Email
3. M-push
4. WhatsApp
5. Zalo
6. Line
7. Viber

### Use Case

A brand wants to include customers whose transactional value is greater than $10,000 in the Journey and communicate the discounts that can be availed by these customers via SMS.

1. Click on the engagement block.
2. In the **Engagement name** text box, enter a name for the engagement block.
