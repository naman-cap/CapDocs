Reachability refers to whether a user can be contacted via a specific communication channel. It helps determine if a particular user can receive messages or notifications sent through that channel.

You can view the reachability status in the audience view detail page.

Example: A user has created a campaign and wants to understand via which communication channel the reachability is more. They can view the reachability under the specific audience group.

To View Reachability follow the given steps below:

1. On **Engage+** navigate to the **Audience** section.

# When is Reachability Calculated?

* **Immediate and Specific Date Messages:** Reachability is computed before campaign creation.
* **Recurring Campaigns:** Reachability for the filter list is calculated at the pre-execution stage.

# Reachability computation

The audience reachability is computed based on the whitelisting (valid mobile or email IDs) and their subscription status. For WhatsApp, the customers who have unsubscribed to a particular brand on WhatsApp are excluded and if the WhatsApp number is not available, the fall back channel will be considered. If a user's subscription status is not available, they are considered available.

<Note title="Note">
If a customer has experienced more than three hard bounces in previous communication attempts, the system automatically blocks future messages to that customer to prevent repeated delivery failures.
