aiRA powered filters are designed to get customers with a specific prediction. When you combine aiRA-powered filters with standard filters, the chances are higher to achieve hit rate, better incremental sales and offer relevant products to customers at the right time.

aiRA power filters use the AI stack of Capillary (AIRA), which has the best in class algorithms with customer tags. These algorithms compute the historical transaction data, customer behavioral data, campaign data, and more to generate an almost accurate prediction.

To apply a zero power filter, follow these steps

1. In New Audience Filters, go to **Apply filter condition** > **Filter** > **AI Power Filters**. \[Know more]
2. Select your preferred filter from the category.
3. Configure the using the **mandatory** and **optional** filter options as required. For details, see the relevant topics.
4. Click **Save Group** to save the audience group.

        You need to set the maximum/minimum probability of transacting with the brand in the selected period.

        This option lets you get the customers with maximum or minimum (0-1) probability of responses with the brand in a selected period. You can select very high (>=0.7), high (\<.7 and >=.3), medium (\<.3 and >=.1), and low (\<.1), and one from the list to get top n customers with the highest or lowest probability of responses with the brand in the next n days.

        For example, you can include customers with a very high probability of transacting with the brand in the next 7, 15, and 30 days; you can include customers whose chances are to make only one transaction in the next 15 days.

## Lapsation prediction

This filter helps you build an audience group with customers that are not likely to transact with the brand. This filter is beneficial for the churn killer campaign.

The lapsation prediction filter helps you to get high CLTV (Customer Life Time Value) to increase customer retention.

## Top N offer propensity

The top n offer propensity filter helps you build an audience group who are likely to respond to specific types of offers.

For example, consider you have a cashback offer enabled and have a budget for targeting or need to target only 1000 customers with the offer. Instead of seeking assistance from the analytics team to identify the most relevant customers, you can utilize the top n offer propensity filter to get top customers who have the highest inclination towards cashback offers.

* Only orgs that are mapped to the data science vertical will have this filter enabled.
