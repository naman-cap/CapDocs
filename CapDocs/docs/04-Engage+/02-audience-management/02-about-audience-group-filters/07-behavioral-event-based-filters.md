As soon as a behavioural event is created and its data becomes available in Insights, an audience filter for that event can be used to segment users. These filters help create audience groups for bulk communications and refine reports in Insights based on event attributes, including segmentation by the number of times a user performed an event.

For example, if a new behavioural event is introduced to track user steps and the device type used for capturing the activity (e.g., Mobile/Smartwatch), brand managers can create an audience group such as:\
"Users who have walked more than 500 steps in the last week and used a mobile device to capture the activity."
