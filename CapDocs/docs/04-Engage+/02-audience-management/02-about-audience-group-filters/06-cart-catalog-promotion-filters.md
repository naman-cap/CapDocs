The filter lets you create audience list with customers who earned specific number of promotions during a selected period.

For example, you wish to filter out users who have earned promotions more than three times in July. Assume the following data is available - Zoha earned 5 promotions in June, Raj earned 2 promotions in July, and Simran 4 promotions in June.

Here, Zoha will be selected as she is the only one who earned more than three promotions in July.

Basic filter options:
