## Transacted date & time

Fetches customers based on their total purchase time. For example, you can get customers who have shopped during the Christmas season (say 20-12-2021 to 30-12-2021). You can apply advanced filters to get a very specific list, say customers who made transactions done on a specific day, time, zone or store.
