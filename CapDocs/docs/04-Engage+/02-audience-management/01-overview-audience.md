Audience Manager lets you create different audience groups based on specific information. Creating audience groups helps you target right customer at right time which makes campaigns more effective. You can create and manage groups seperately based on information like behavior, interests, demographic details, transactions, and more. For example, you can get high spending customers that did not visit your stores for the last three months.
