SMS enables organizations to send timely and personalized text messages to their customers. These messages can be used for a variety of purposes, including promotional campaigns, service notifications, and transactional alerts such as OTPs and order confirmations.

For organizations operating in India, SMS communication is governed by TRAI's DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) regulations. To comply with these regulations, organizations must complete the following steps:

* Register as an entity on a DLT platform
* Register and get approval for sender IDs (also known as headers)
* Register message templates under one of the three approved categories:
  * Promotional
  * Service Explicit
  * Service Implicit\
    For more information refer to Create SMS Template for Indian Orgs (as per TRAI Regulations) documentation.

For non-Indian organizations, the process is simpler, involving direct content creation without DLT compliance. For more information refer to Create SMS template for other Orgs documentation.
