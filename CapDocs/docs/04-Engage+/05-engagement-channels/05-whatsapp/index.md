A WhatsApp template is a message format that you can reuse to message users who have opted-in (taking opt-in is recommended but not enforced by WhatsApp) and given your app with the permission to send them messages.

To use a message template, you need to first submit it to WhatsApp. WhatsApp reviews and approves each message template, officially in 24-48 hours, to maintain high-quality content and avoid spam. Once WhatsApp has approved your template, you can use the message template to send notifications.

You can use WhatsApp channel to notify your customers about various offers and discounts, transaction, shipping information, OTPs and many more details through WhatsApp. Engage+ and Loyalty+ both supports WhatsApp notifications.

Once you create a template in Creatives, we get it approved for you without any additional effort from your end.

* Capillary makes use of a Business Service Provider which acts as a gateway between Capillary and WhatsApp. As Capillary maintains your brand's customer data, It is suggested to use Capillary over any Business Service Providers. It reduces your efforts to send data again to a new service provider.
* If a customer doesn't have a WhatsApp-compatible [V2 profile](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/customer-profiles#/v2-profile-identifier-addupdate), the system finds their linked mobile number for SMS and attempts to send the message to that number.
