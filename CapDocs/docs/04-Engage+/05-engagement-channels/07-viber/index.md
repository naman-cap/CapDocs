Viber is a cross-platform voice-over IP (VoIP) and instant messaging (IM) app that enables organizations to engage with customers in a secure and personalized way using messages and stickers. It helps build one-to-one connections and makes customer interactions more personal and effective.

In Engage+, you can create and manage reusable Viber message and sticker templates. While creating a template, you can define the message content (up to 1000 characters), insert personalized labels, and optionally include images, videos, and action buttons. The platform supports specific media requirements for image and video attachments, as well as secure URLs for clickable buttons.
