Call tasks are messages sent to store staff that serve as suggestions or instructions. These messages can only be created within the message creation section under a campaign.

Users can create a call task by selecting a template from the Call Task tab under Creative templates or by creating a new template. Each call task requires a title, a message, and a description. The message can include labels and Liquid language for personalization. The description helps store staff understand the context of the task.

There is also an option to enable the task for the Store2Door app by selecting Use in Store2Door, which allows users to preview how the message will appear in the app before saving.
