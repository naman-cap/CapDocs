**Q1: If a communication rate is not specified for a channel in the UI, what default rate is applied?**

A: For costing details related to each communication channel, please reach out to the Gateway team.

**Q2: Can an email be sent that allows a member to change their status (for example, opt out of the program)? Can this be achieved by adding a prebuilt option within the email?**

A: No, adding a prebuilt option in the email to change a member’s program status is not possible. Member account deletion or status change can only be done through Member Care. From email, you can only capture opt-in/opt-out confirmations for subscriptions, which apply to communication preferences, not program status.

**Q3: Is it possible to import WhatsApp creatives in bulk on the Engage platform, instead of uploading them individually?**

A: No, bulk import of WhatsApp creatives is not supported.

**Q4: A brand was targeting around 75,000 unique customers, but after some recipients blocked the number due to irrelevant content, WhatsApp reduced the brand’s messaging limit. Approximately how many unique customers can the brand now target?**

A: WhatsApp can reduce the messaging limit if many users block or report the brand. However, WhatsApp does not disclose a specific number or percentage for the new limit.

**Q5: A customer’s status was changed from Unsubscribed to Subscribed in Member Care, an email was sent but did not reach the customer. Does the status change take time to reflect, causing a delay in email delivery?**

A: Yes. Since the data is computed from Insights, it takes up to 24 hours for the update to reflect.

**Q6: If a brand’s WhatsApp limit is set to 1,000 unique customers for the first two weeks and they complete their quota (already sent messages to 1,000 unique customers) within the first week, when is the earliest they can send a message to a new customer?**

A: The earliest a brand can send a message to a new customer is after the two-week (14-day) limit period resets. The communication limit is enforced for the entire set period, so once the quota is reached, no new unique customers can be messaged until the next period begins.

**Q7: How should the bounce “Email message does not meet the recipient server’s policies” be classified?**

A: This bounce is classified as a hard bounce. In Capillary reporting, a hard bounce is a permanent email delivery failure for example, when the recipient server rejects the message due to policy violations such as content restrictions, authentication issues, or security rules.
