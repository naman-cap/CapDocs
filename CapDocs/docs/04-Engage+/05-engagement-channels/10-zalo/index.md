Zalo, a popular communication channel in Vietnam, can be used to send messages through the Zalo notification service (ZNS). Zalo templates must be configured through the Capillary Gateway support team and approved by Zalo. Once approved, you can preview and use the templates in campaigns and journeys. Templates can be edited after adding them to a campaign or journey.
