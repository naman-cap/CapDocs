Email enables organizations to create and manage personalized, visually engaging messages for their campaigns.\
You can choose to upload your own HTML creatives or use the intuitive drag-and-drop editor to build messages from scratch or predefined templates.

There are two modes to create email content:

**Upload Zip File**: Import custom-designed HTML files packaged as .zip, .html, or .htm. Modify text, images, and layout using Liquid tags for personalization, and include dynamic headers/footers using organization-level custom fields.

**Create Using Editor**: Use the built-in editor to create responsive emails by selecting from predefined templates or starting from scratch. Customize layout using rows and content blocks like text, images, buttons, and barcodes.

The editor supports both design and code views, allowing easy switching for advanced users. You can preview and test your email content before sending to ensure accuracy and design consistency across devices.

All email messages must include an unsubscribe tag to comply with communication standards. It also supports dynamic content rendering, barcode integration, and responsive layouts tailored for desktop and mobile.
