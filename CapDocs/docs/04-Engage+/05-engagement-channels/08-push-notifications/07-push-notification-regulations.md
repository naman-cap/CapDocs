Push notifications can be intrusive as they appear directly on customers’ phones through your app. Each platform (Android and iOS) have specific guidelines for sending push notifications. 

Ensure that push notifications comply with the Apple App Store and Google Play Store policies for using push messages for advertisements and promotions.

        [4.5.4 ](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#apple-sites-and-services)

         Push Notifications must not be required for the app to function, and should not be used to send sensitive personal or confidential information. Push Notifications should not be used for promotions or direct marketing purposes unless customers have explicitly opted in to receive them via consent language displayed in your app’s UI, and you provide a method in your app for a user to opt out from receiving such messages. Abuse of these services may result in revocation of your privileges.

          You may not monetize built-in capabilities provided by the hardware or operating system, such as Push Notifications, the camera, or the gyroscope; or Apple services and technologies, such as Apple Music access, iCloud storage, or Screen Time APIs.

        [**Unauthorized Use or Imitation of System Functionality:**](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9969861?hl=en)

        We don’t allow apps or ads that mimic or interfere with system functionality, such as notifications or warnings. System-level notifications may only be used for an app’s integral features, such as an airline app that notifies users of special deals, or a game that notifies users of in-game promotions.
