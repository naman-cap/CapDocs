To make sure push notifications reach users, it's important to improve how they are sent and received. This includes getting more users to opt in, making sure messages are delivered successfully, and resending failed notifications at the right time. Using the right strategies can help keep users engaged and informed.

# Increasing Opt-Ins

To send push notifications to a user, they must opt-in for the service. If the user declines, convincing them to re-enable push notifications can be challenging as they have the final decision to opt in or out.

Using a Push Primer in-app message before the system-level prompt to explain the benefits of enabling push notifications is an effective way to increase opt-in rates. This approach helps users make an informed decision and makes them more likely to opt-in to the push notification service.
