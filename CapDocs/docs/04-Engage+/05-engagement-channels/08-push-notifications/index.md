Push notifications are messages sent to a user’s device, alerting them to new content, updates, or important events. Push Notifications effectively reach customers, keeping them engaged and informed about your campaigns.

Push notifications serve several key purposes:

**Informing:** Delivering important updates or alerts to users in real-time. These notifications can alert users to updates, confirmations, reminders, or time-sensitive events. Ensure the information is clear and concise to keep users informed without overwhelming them.

**Engaging:** Encouraging user interaction with the app through time-sensitive and relevant messages. They can be used to notify users of relevant activities, updates, or available actions. By providing timely and useful information, these notifications keep users actively involved with the app’s features and functionalities.

**Re-engaging:** Encourage inactive users to return to the app with personalized content or offers. Remind users of pending actions, suggest personalized content, or offer incentives to return. Re-engagement notifications are a useful strategy to reduce app abandonment and maintain user interest.

**Promoting:** Highlighting new features, products, or promotions to drive user engagement. Use these notifications to generate excitement and drive sales. Ensure your promotional messages are clear and concise to capture attention without overwhelming users.
