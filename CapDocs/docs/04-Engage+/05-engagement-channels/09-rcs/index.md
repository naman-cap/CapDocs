## Introduction

RCS is a next-generation SMS protocol that upgrades text messages with rich features like branding, media, and analytics. It is aimed to replace SMS with a richer text format.

RCS combines the messaging features of popular messaging apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger but delivered through the default SMS messaging app. RCS is delivered as an SMS but supports extensive media support such as images, videos, branding, CTAs (Call to Actions) and more. Unlike SMS, RCS facilitates you to track the metrics of the message like open rate and link click rate.

## Features of RCS

* Enables brands to have their verified profile, business profile picture, and bio which increases the brandâ€™s verifiability.
* RCS offers detailed analytics of executed campaigns. This includes messages delivered, opened and link click rates. 
* Capillary allows brands to configure fallback SMS within an RCS Campaign so that users who are not reachable on RCS can be automatically reached out through SMS.
  * Fallback SMS mechanism:  When a certain audience is not reachable through RCS, then the system will send the configured fallback SMS to the user.
