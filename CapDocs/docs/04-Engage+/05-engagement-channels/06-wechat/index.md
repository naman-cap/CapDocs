WeChat enables businesses to connect with customers through targeted messages within one of China’s most widely used social media platforms. It supports two types of message templates—Map and Rich Media—designed to deliver both transactional updates and engaging promotional content.

With Capillary’s WeChat content creation module, users can build customized templates based on their communication needs. Map templates are suited for sending plain text messages, typically for transactional or offer-related notifications. Rich Media templates allow for more dynamic messaging, combining text with elements like images, audio, and location details.

The platform provides an intuitive interface to create these templates, add relevant details such as headers, keywords, mini-program links, and define who can engage with the content. This ensures brands can deliver personalized, on-brand communication directly to their WeChat audience.
