## Overview

The Offer Management System (CMS) is a central repository for managing global coupons. You can create coupons in one place and use them across various servicesâ€”whether internal services like campaigns and loyalty programs or external services through third-party integrations. Once one service utilises an offer, it becomes unavailable to others. This tool is solely for creating offers with coupon codes; you will need to use other services to send the coupon codes to customers

## Key features of CMS:

* **Personalised Coupons**: Create customised coupons tailored to specific needs.
* **Expiry Settings:** Set coupon expiry either on a fixed date or based on the validity of a targeted campaign.
* **Association:** Link coupons to specific products or organisational units (OUs).
* **Coupon Generation:** Choose to generate coupon codes automatically or upload them manually.
* **Customer Targeting:** Associate coupons with particular sets of customers.
* **Discount Types:** Create either percentage-based or flat discount coupons.
* **Issuance Limits:** Limit the number of coupons issued per customer or promotion.
* **Redemption Restrictions:** Restrict coupon use based on parameters such as transaction amount, date, and time.
* **Expiry Notifications:** Automate reminders and notifications for expiring coupons.
* **Dashboard**: Access a dashboard to view coupon details including creation and expiry dates, usage by different services (e.g., Loyalty, Outbound, Timeline), and redemption counts.
* **Performance Tracking:** Monitor coupon performance and redemption rates to refine marketing strategies.
