      2. Select " \*\*Days from issual"\*\*for the coupon to expire after a certain number of days from the issue date or the campaign end date, whichever comes first.
         * For example, If a coupon is issued on 12th November 0 days from issual Expires on 12th Nov EOD and 1 day from issual Expires on 13th Nov EOD .
      3. You can also choose "**Month ends from issual"** for the coupon to expire after a specified number of months from the issue date or the campaign end date which is earlier.

* Automatically create unique codes
* Give a common code to all coupons
* Upload existing coupon codes

You can add customers when you [create an offer](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/create-offer-1#create-offers) or by navigating to **Engage+** > **Incentive** > **More Options** under the offer name > **Upload customers**.

Below is the screenshot of a sample file to upload multiple coupons for a customer

1. Enable **‚ÄúRestrict based on past coupon issuals**‚Äù  so that you can prevent customers from receiving coupons they've already used in the past 6 months and Select the offer from the past 6 months from the drop-down. The selected coupons will not be sent to the customers who have received these coupons in the past 6 months.

* Select **If a customer matches the criteria again** .
* Select **Send existing valid coupon** to send the same coupon again.

## Configuring the Redemption settings

To configure various redemption limits and rules for how and when coupons can be redeemed, perform the following :

1. Enable **Coupon can be shared and redeemed by anyone** to allow redemption of a coupon by anyone, for example friends and family. You can limit the number of times the coupon is redeemed. This additionally also gives access to set limits on **Coupon code limit**. You need to issue the coupon to at least one user to enable it for redemption by any customer.

![8b197c1790365cc9aa970dd881c7e6af3b1521eef80b7c4970af4d40dd13d1a0 Screenshot 2025 03 05 at 1](https://files.readme.io/8b197c1790365cc9aa970dd881c7e6af3b1521eef80b7c4970af4d40dd13d1a0-Screenshot_2025-03-05_at_1.21.16_PM.png)

2. Configure the coupon code limits under **Coupon code limit, Individual customer limit** and **Across customer limit.**

* **Coupon code limit** - The 'coupon code limit' feature allows brands to set a maximum number of times a specific coupon code can be redeemed across all customers. This ensures that once the set limit is reached, the code can no longer be used, regardless of how many different customers attempt to redeem it.\
  USECASE: A brand runs a promotion using the coupon code "SUMMER50", offering a 50% discount. Without a coupon code limit, an unlimited number of customers could redeem the code, potentially leading to higher-than-expected discounts.
  By setting a coupon code limit of 1,000 redemptions, the brand ensures that only the first 1,000 customers can use the code. Once the limit is reached, the code becomes invalid, preventing excessive discount usage.
* **Individual customer limit** - The 'Individual customer limit' feature allows brands to set the maximum number of times a single customer can redeem a specific coupon code. Once a customer reaches their redemption limit, they cannot use the code again, even if the coupon is still available for other customers.\
  USECASE 1: A brand offers a "WELCOME10" coupon that gives a 10% discount on purchases. To prevent misuse, they set the Individual customer limit to 1.
  This ensures that each customer can only use the coupon once, even though the code may still be available for others. This helps the brand maintain the promotion‚Äôs intended purpose‚Äîrewarding new customers without allowing repeated use by the same person.
  USECASE 2: In the case of the Step Function, the limit should be set to no limit because the number of coupons issued depends on the transaction amount and cannot be predetermined. However, the redemption limit can be set depending on how many times a particular issued coupon can be redeemed. To know more about Step Function, click [here](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/january-february-march23#loyalty).
* **Across customer limit** -\
  The 'Across customer limit' feature controls the total number of redemptions allowed across all coupon codes within a specific series. This ensures that once the predefined limit is reached, no additional redemptions can occur, even if individual codes or customers still have remaining redemption allowances.
  This is particularly useful for large-scale promotions where multiple codes are distributed but the brand wants to cap the overall number of discounts given out. It provides a way to manage total redemptions across a campaign while still allowing flexibility at the individual coupon and customer levels.
  USECASE: A brand launches a holiday sale where they distribute 5,000 unique coupon codes, each offering a discount.
  To control the total discount given, they set a Series-Level Limit of 50,000 redemptions. This means that even though each individual code may have its own redemption limit, once the total redemptions across all codes in the series reach 50,000, no further redemptions will be allowed.
  This helps the brand manage the overall budget for the promotion while still allowing multiple customers to redeem different codes.

# Revoke Coupon

When a cashier redeems a coupon in case of an internet outage, you can expire such coupons instead of doing a manual cleanup at the backend.\
To expire active coupons, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to **Engage+** and Select  **Incentives**.
2. Click the three dots next to the offer you want to revoke.
3. Click **Revoke Coupons.**

![74a42c043d4fd74485563b09adcdad1fb65b3ee2ae6574297fd0ffb618c10e27 Screenshot 2024 10 09 123823](https://files.readme.io/74a42c043d4fd74485563b09adcdad1fb65b3ee2ae6574297fd0ffb618c10e27-Screenshot_2024-10-09_123823.png)

4. Select your desired revoking option.

   * **All unredeemed coupons (Issued and unissued)**: To expire all coupons that are either not redeemed or issued.
   * **Only unissued coupons:** To expire only coupons that are not issued.
   * **For specific customers:** To expire all active coupons of particular customers. Create a CSV file with identifiers of customers whose coupons you want to expire, and upload the file using Upload Customer.

   ![e022ae37d954c017e33a37e0f34cb0842913966f228a58ea1d58b91c53692bdd Screenshot 2024 09 30 161355](https://files.readme.io/e022ae37d954c017e33a37e0f34cb0842913966f228a58ea1d58b91c53692bdd-Screenshot_2024-09-30_161355.png)
5. Check **I understand that revoking coupons will make them unredeemable**. Expired coupons cannot be redeemed or reversed.
6. Click **Revoke**.

A message is shown that the customer data is successfully uploaded. All the coupons issued to the selected customer are revoked and ready for use.

Notes: You cannot revoke redeemed coupons. If a customer has multiple active coupons from the same series, then all active coupons are revoked.

### Transfer of Coupon

You can revoke the coupon and then assign the same coupon code to the intended customer through coupon upload, as transferring a coupon from one customer to another customer is not supported.

# Personalization of coupon at scale

Personalization of coupon at scale (audience of 20M+) : This is a limited release and is enabled as an add-on. This is not a part of any standard package. Please reach out to your CSM to enable the personalization of the coupon feature.

To create this follow the steps:

1. Navigate to the **Engage +** module and click on **Incentives**.
2. Click on\**[Create Offer\*](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/create-offer-1#create-offers)* .

![f50cdb4cefdb88563a0b2ddf9bbc872aa072fd900a405de3a5539cd4329a08f3 Screenshot 2024 10 09 130315](https://files.readme.io/f50cdb4cefdb88563a0b2ddf9bbc872aa072fd900a405de3a5539cd4329a08f3-Screenshot_2024-10-09_130315.png)

3. Enter the basic details of the coupon series like **offer name, offer expiry, discount value for each coupon(fixed/percentage), products applicable** etc.
4. While selecting how to generate coupon codes for the series :

   * Select **Through capillary.**
   * Click on **Generate common codes(s) -> Generate randomized common code(s).**

   ![9f84d1442cccf7140726c329efeebd49b8e2a97c50989e0429ae381f44b8cf17 Screenshot 2024 10 09 135524](https://files.readme.io/9f84d1442cccf7140726c329efeebd49b8e2a97c50989e0429ae381f44b8cf17-Screenshot_2024-10-09_135524.png)
5. Enter the sample common code, it could be numeric or alphanumeric.

![925669bc7f2dca398f56cf6deb7804e402cf31553213a457624b85d8743ae9e8 Screenshot 2024 10 09 135855](https://files.readme.io/925669bc7f2dca398f56cf6deb7804e402cf31553213a457624b85d8743ae9e8-Screenshot_2024-10-09_135855.png)

* Here, in this case, TEST12345 is just a sample code to generate the randomized codes from this reference.
* The system will take the length of the sample code provided and if it is numeric or alphanumeric and then generate the random codes based on this input.
* The resulting codes will be of the same length and will have 50% of the code as fixed for all the codes, i.e. in this case, let‚Äôs say TEST will be fixed and the remaining 5 digits will be randomly generated.
* The fixed part will be unique in the backend for an org.\
  Note: Min 5 characters should be there in the sample code and Max. of 10 characters is supported.

![fe5bbd1b6a983aaaa75a7ee495350d7ec881e5aafc749d1d24cf49a7d6c404cd Screenshot 2024 10 09 140244](https://files.readme.io/fe5bbd1b6a983aaaa75a7ee495350d7ec881e5aafc749d1d24cf49a7d6c404cd-Screenshot_2024-10-09_140244.png)

6. Once the offer is created, the sample code provided at the time of creation can‚Äôt be changed and in the UI, in edit flow, it won‚Äôt be the same code which was provided at the time of offer creation.

![f84a87d45e70f733bac7c14b62dec85ac0d80beaec8a24cef786eb1448980f1b Screenshot 2024 10 09 140724](https://files.readme.io/f84a87d45e70f733bac7c14b62dec85ac0d80beaec8a24cef786eb1448980f1b-Screenshot_2024-10-09_140724.png)

* This option is only available when offers are created from the incentives section but can be claimed in any module.
* This type of series can only be created via UI and not via coupon APIs.
* The feature of uploading customers won‚Äôt be available for this type of coupon series.
* This option is not available for offers created via campaign flow or loyalty flow.
* Time to issue 30M coupons via campaigns flows 3 hours.
* With this feature, we can issue a maximum of 60 million unique coupons when 10-digit alphanumeric characters are used to create a coupon series.\
  Note: The system allows for coupons to have multiple currencies and it is important to note that the coupon value will be converted to the store default currency at the time of transaction.

# Track the reversal status of a coupon

This feature allows brands to easily indicate which coupons have been reversed and reinstated in the mobile app's user interface.

* This will help customers to easily identify the coupon that was reversed, thus reducing confusion and the number of queries made to support.
* Additionally, this feature will also improve the customer's experience by providing them with transparency and visibility into the status of their coupons.
* Brands can also use this feature to track and analyse the performance of their coupon campaigns and make data-driven decisions to optimise their rewards strategy.

Impacted APIs :\
Get Customer Coupons
Get Coupon details

In both the API response, isReversed and last\_status\_change\_on values would be returning from the coupon\_redemptions table based on the active and last\_status\_change\_on columns.

# Coupon APIs

* If you specify a zone in the API call, it will only return offers tagged to that zone, not to individual stores within it. For example, if a brand has stores A, B, and C in zone 1, using "zone 1" will only show offers for that zone, not for stores A, B, or C. To get offers for those specific stores, you need to include their store IDs in the API call.
* The provided orgEntityIds won't be validated, meaning if an invalid ID is entered (not a proper store, zone, or concept ID), no error will be shown; instead, you simply won't receive any results for that ID.
* You can only filter by one orgEntityType at a time in a single request.

## Manage Store and Zone-Level Redemption Settings

This helps brands select & upload store names while creating a coupon series to restrict the coupon redemption to those stores. However, brands generally run scope restrictions based on store name.

To add store IDs for coupon series via Thrift,

```
SaveCouponConfigRequest:  
          CouponConfiguration:  
                      redemptionOrgEntityDetails:  
                                <orgEntityId
                                redemptionOrgEntityType>,  
                                <orgEntityId
                                redemptionOrgEntityType>,
```

API based implementation details,

1. redemptionOrgEntityDetails is a list of redemptionOrgEntityType and orgEntityId.
2. Add redemptionOrgEntityType as STORE, ZONE or CONCEPT.
3. Add orgEntityId as a store, zone or concept id.
4. This is to be added in thrift SaveCouponConfigRequest to make a thrift call for saveCouponConfiguration.

To filter store IDs for coupon series via Thrift:

1. Add orgEntityType as STORE, ZONE or CONCEPT.
2. Add orgEntityIds with a list of store, zone or concept IDs.
3. This is to be added in thrift GetAllCouponConfigsRequest to make a thrift call for getAllCouponConfigurations.
