## Introduction

The VisitorSense is a combination of VisitorMetrix and CaptureEdge devices that count visitor traffic (footfall) and identifies their demographics. The data are saved directly to the Capillary CRM server. Footfall count and demographics are key metrics for store managers and Capillary experts to draw relevant insights and make informed decisions to drive up conversion rate and improve business.

**VisitorMetrix (VM):** A footfall counter used to measure store traffic. It is a computer vision based device that works on a proprietary machine-learning algorithm to provide over 95% accuracy in all retail store conditions despite variations in floor height, light, floor color, or pattern over a period of time. VM can measure group count and effectively eliminate false counts of kids, non-living objects, and store staff (with the help of StaffCounter switch). 

**CaptureEdge:** The Capillary CaptureEdge is powered by machine-learning based AI algorithm with real-time camera vision processing that provides more advanced features when combined with VisitorMetrix such as visitor demographics, fashion profiling, and conversion insights. The combo - VisitorMetrix and CaptureEdge - is called VisitorSense.

The CaptureEdge device identifies the gender and approximate age of store visitors.  This data helps in understanding which age group customers are visiting your stores and what kind of items are of interest to different customer group segments. The VisitorMetrix device sends signals to CaptureEdge on when to capture data based on the walk-ins recorded thus avoids unnecessary captures.

The device is designed to use in different business segments such as malls, hypermarkets, retail stores (MBOs and EBOs) and in all industries including QSR to track the conversion ratio on a daily basis and make smart business decisions to drive sales and profits.

**Staff Counter:** The VisitorMetrix device tallies in and out counts, but not everyone who comes to the store is a customer. For example, store staff and delivery persons. To avoid such false data and provide accurate business performance metrics, Staff Counter is also provided with the package. The device is installed at the entrance and needs to be configured using InStore. You can configure to track either in count or out count but not both. At the end of the day, the system automatically eliminates the staff count from the total visitor count (VisitorMetrix count) and provides the actual data.  For more details on Staff Counter configuration, see Configuring the Staff Counter Device.
