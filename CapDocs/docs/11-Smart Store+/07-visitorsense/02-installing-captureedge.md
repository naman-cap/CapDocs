## Installing the Device

Once you locate the mounting location, ensure that a power socket is available in less than 1.5 meters to the device. If the power supply is not available, install a new socket. We will provide all the necessary hardware extensions required for installation along with the package.  

**Note:** If you are unfamiliar about the electrical wiring in the walls, consult a professional technician.

* Install the extension rod provided with the package
* Facing the device camera towards the store, fix the device to the extension rod using the screws provided with the package
* Connect the internet cable in the LAN socket
* Connect the power cable to the device
* Plug the adapter into the power supply
* Switch on the power supply. The power LED on the device should glow if the device is getting the power
