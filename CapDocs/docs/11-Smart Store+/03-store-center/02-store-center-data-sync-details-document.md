## What is Synchronization?

The synchronization process updates data between the main server and the local server to which Store Center is connected.

The sync process starts automatically after logging on to the Store Center. The duration for sync completion varies depending on the amount of data to be synced and your Internet speed.

## Sync Types

The sync process is categorized into three kinds based on the sync behavior:

* **Fresh Sync:** Fresh Sync happens when you log on to the Store Center for the first time. During Fresh Sync, the entire data available in the local server is uploaded to the main server and the entire main server data is downloaded to the local server. Fresh Sync completion is checked after every one hour until the entire process is complete
* Delta Sync: Delta sync downloads and uploads only the updated data. Instead of updating the entire data every time, Delta Sync saves updating time and server load by synchronizing only the fresh data from both local server and Capillary server. Delta Sync happens every time you log in to the Store Center. However, for Delta Sync to happen, the Fresh Sync should have completed successfully
* **Manual Sync:** Manual sync can be chosen when the Fresh or Delta sync fails. You can select the manual sync option from the Sync window of Advanced Settings
