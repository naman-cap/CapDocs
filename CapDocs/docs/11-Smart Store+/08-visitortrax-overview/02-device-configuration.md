Once the device is installed, you need to configure the device through InStore to set up the capture area and mark the zones to track the customer journey inside the store. For which, you need to have InStore on any POS machine with the FFC tab enabled.

The following are the steps to configure VisitorTrax.

* Login to InStore and navigate to the InstoreAI tab. InStore starts fetching the installed devices automatically.
* Configure the zones. For details, see zone configuration.
