Gamification has been introduced to keep the staff motivated and to be more productive. After achieving the desired target or after completing an assigned task efficiently. A badge is awarded to the staff, which can be viewed in the staff profile on Storemax. The Leaderboard ranks the staff based on their performance, promoting healthy competition among the staff. The leaderboard changes every day.
