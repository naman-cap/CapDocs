After opening a task, the staff can initiate a conversation with the customer regarding the products on WhatsApp. If the customer is interested to communicate further, the staff can recommend products to the customer based on their purchase history. If the customer does not want to receive further messages, the staff can Unsubscribe, After the task has been completed, the staff can close the task.
