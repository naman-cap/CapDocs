The "Available without issue" loyalty promotions also called GENERIC promotions in the backend are accessible to all customers and are automatically triggered to provide benefits such as points or tier upgrades based on predefined rules, behavioural events, or milestone completions. They are aimed at rewarding customer loyalty and fostering repeat purchases. This is similar to the basic promotion. 

These loyalty promotions are not specifically issued to individual customers instead benefits are directly provided to the customers when they meet the defined criteria. When a customer meets the requirements, the promotion is automatically applied to their transaction, resulting in the issuance of benefits such as loyalty points, tier upgrades, coupons, or badges.

1. Select **Available to Issue** from the **Promotion type** option.
2. In the **Condition** expression text box, define the criteria to issue the promotion in the expression language.
3. In the **Add action**, select the benefits that need to be provided upon meeting the criteria.
