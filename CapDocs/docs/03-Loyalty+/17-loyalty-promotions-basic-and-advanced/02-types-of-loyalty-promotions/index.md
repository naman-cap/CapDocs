There are three different types of Loyalty promotions: 

1. Available without issue - Benefits are directly provided to customers on meeting the requirements.
2. Direct issue - Direct issue loyalty promotions, also known as LOYALTY promotions in the backend, are a type of promotion where a specific promotion is initially issued to customers based on their behavioural events or transactions. Subsequently, upon meeting the criteria defined in the promotion during their next transaction, the benefits are provided.
3. Enrol & Issue (Backend: LOYALTY\_EARNING) - This loyalty promotion type follows a three-step process:
   * Enrollment: Customers are first enrolled in the loyalty promotion.
   * Issuance: The loyalty promotion is then issued to enrolled customers based on specific criteria.
   * Redemption of loyalty promotion/Earning the benefits: Customers receive benefits upon meeting the requirements outlined in the issued promotion.
