# Sample customer journeys with games

## Onboarding journey:

When a customer joins a loyalty program, they are presented with a welcome message and a brief introduction to the program, including any games that are part of the program. The customer is encouraged to try out the games and earn points or other rewards.

## Engagement journey:

As the customer interacts with the loyalty program, they are presented with opportunities to play games and earn rewards. For example, the customer might earn a coupon for playing a certain game, or they might earn points for reaching a certain level in a game. These rewards incentivize the customer to continue playing games and engaging with the loyalty program.
