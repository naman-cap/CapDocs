**Background**

For MLP orgs, we support group redemption that enables customers to use their points across programs and redeem them. Similarly while doing the purchase from the reward catalog, we support the functionality to use the points across the programs.

* This allows customers to redeem rewards from multiple programs at once and make the most of their accumulated points.
* This feature also allows customers to easily compare the rewards available across all programs and make informed decisions about how to redeem their points.
* It also simplifies the redemption process for customers as they do not have to navigate through multiple programs to redeem their rewards.
* This feature also allows MLP organizations to better track and manage the redemption of points across multiple programs, and make data-driven decisions to optimize their rewards strategy.
* It also allows customers to redeem rewards with more ease and flexibility.

**User journey:**

* The customer will first choose the reward, then view the available rewards they wish to purchase.
* When attempting to buy a reward, the system will check the customer's points balance across all programs
* Points redemption will occur dynamically based on the customer's available points across all programs.
* Once the points are used, reward will be issued to the customer.

**To get started:**
