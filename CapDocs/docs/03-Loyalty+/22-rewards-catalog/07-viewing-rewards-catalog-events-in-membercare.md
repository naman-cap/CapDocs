**Background**

For a long time, brands have been setting up their rewards catalog (aka Marvel) and these rewards would be redeemed by the customers in exchange for points. 

There was no view of these activities in Member Care because of which they were not able to see the details of points, rewards and transactions for any reward redeemed by a customer and they were not able to take any action against those rewards. Leading to poor customer experience and grievance handling.

**Enhancement**

With the new updates, brands can now view the transaction, reward, point details against a reward in Member care. The Vendor Rewards flow now includes the display of coupon codes, providing visibility to users.

**To get started,**

1. Go to Membercare >> Events >> Rewards catalog
2. Under the Rewards catalog section, you will see all the events for the rewards redeemed by the customer

   2. Transaction Status : Successful/Failed
   3. Redemption Date and Time : 03 Feb 2023 10:34 am
   4. Transaction ID : 30287
