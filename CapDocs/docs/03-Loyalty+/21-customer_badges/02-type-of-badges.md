# Direct issue (Earn)

In the case of directly issued badges, customers receive the badge automatically upon completing the specified activity or meeting the predefined criteria. There is no requirement for customers to enroll in the badge beforehand. For example, you can create a directly issued badge that is available to all customers who complete a particular action or achieve a specific milestone. Once the criteria are met, the badge is awarded to the customer without any further steps required.

# Enrol and issue badges (Issue earn)

Enrol and issue badges require customers to first enrol in the badge before they can earn it. Customers must actively opt-in or sign up for the badge program. Once enrolled, they need to complete the designated activity or meet the specified requirements to qualify for the badge. Only after fulfilling these prerequisites will the badge be issued to the customer. This approach adds a step where customers express their interest or commitment to earning the badge before they can receive it, potentially increasing engagement and participation in the badge program.
