# Overview

To create a flexible badges platform, it is important to give brands the ability to include additional, custom information when creating badges. This custom data can be used for various purposes such as displaying personalized information within the app or website, and for accounting or reporting purposes.\
Additionally, this custom data can also help brands to track and analyze the performance of their badges, and make data-driven decisions to improve their badges strategy. Furthermore, the ability to include custom data can also help brands to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, and to report on the performance of the badges to stakeholders.

# Usecase

A retail brand aims to establish a badges platform to reward loyal customers and foster engagement through their mobile app. To personalize the badge experience, the brand intends to display custom information associated with each badge earned by users. To implement this the brand can perform the following:

1. Create a custom field named "Terms & Conditions" with the data type set as STRING.
2. Create a badge and assign this custom field "Terms & Conditions," ensuring to populate it with relevant information.

When a customer earns the badge, it will be showcased along with the "Terms & Conditions" field, providing users with pertinent details about the badge. Examples of custom field content may include terms and conditions, redemption instructions, brief descriptions, legal text, exclusivity status, purpose, etc.

# Notes

1. Custom fields can be created, updated, or disabled.
2. There can be only one active custom field with the same name. If the existing custom field is disabled, then a new custom field with the same name can be created.
3. It is mandatory to define the default value for a custom field which is mandatory for the badge. In case a badge doesn't define a mandatory custom field with it, the default value will be considered.
4. Data types supported in custom fields: boolean, integer, string, and date.
5. Once the custom field is disabled, it can't be enabled again.
6. Only active custom fields will be returned in all the getcalls.
7. Only below fields can be updated while updating the custom field:
   1. Name : can be updated
   2. Isactive : can be updated from true to false but false to true is not allowed
   3. Default value can be updated
   4. Ismandatory can be updated from true to false or false to true
   5. Data type canâ€™t be updated
8. There is no limit on the number of custom fields that can be defined at an org level for badges.
