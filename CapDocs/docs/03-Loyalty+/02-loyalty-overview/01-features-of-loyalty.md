Loyalty+ has a very easy-to-use UI and a powerful rule engine that has the flexibility to create rules based on various parameters such as loyalty type, promotions, customer spending. It provides the flexibility to create context-based loyalty programs, for example, 

* **Basic Loyalty Programs** let customers enroll in the loyalty program and get incentivized with points or coupons for every transaction they make.
* **Paid enrollment programs** are also called membership-based loyalty programs which allow customers to buy loyalty status (tier) to enjoy the tier benefits.

#### Create flexible tiers

Loyalty+ provides you the flexibility to set up tier upgrade and downgrade conditions based on the customers' frequency of visits. You can also have tier upgrade based on purchases made by group members, customer tagging to customize the loyalty program to suit the brandâ€™s needs.

You can configure conditions to downgrade their tier when they do not make any transaction for a certain period.\
For example, assume that a loyalty customer makes frequent purchases in the first month and achieves a higher level tier and during the second month, the frequency of visits is low, you can downgrade the tier based on the recent transaction period. 

#### Numerous ways of incentivization

There are a number of different types of loyalty programs that can be configured using Loyalty+ and you can incentivize your customers in multiple ways, in the form of points, coupons, promotions, etc.

#### Incentivize non-loyalty customers

Moving the non-loyalty customers to loyalty customers can be done through various Loyalty+ drives. For example, Loyalty+ supports issuing coupons to non-loyalty customers on an event. This ultimately increases engagement and strengthens the Loyalty Base.  

#### Incentivization through payment modes

Loyalty+ can be used to incentivize customers based on the payment mode used for a transaction. Loyalty+ supports incentivizing for different card types such as payments through Debit Cards, Credit Cards, Visa, and Mastercard. It also allows incentivizing bonus points based on banks. For example, award 10x points when a customer transacts with an HDFC card. 

#### Omnichannel Loyalty

Loyalty+ supports Omni-channel loyalty, i.e., you can configure actions for the selected sources/accounts. The points are earned and burned seamlessly in online/offline platforms. Customers can be notified about the loyalty updates through a number of channels including SMS, email, Mobile Push and WeChat. All cross-channel registrations of a customer have been combined automatically and associated with a single account.

#### Loyalty for Conglomerates

Organizations with multiple brands can configure a different loyalty program for each brand while maintaining a single customer profile across the organization using the Multiple Loyalty Programs (MLP) feature in Loyalty+. This feature can also be used to create multi-country loyalty programs.

#### Communication channels

The communication channels supported in the loyalty workflows are SMS, Email and Push notifications.
