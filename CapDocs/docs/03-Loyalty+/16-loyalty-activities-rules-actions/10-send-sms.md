> ðŸ“˜ * As an SMS has a character limit, it is usual that the links that you use in SMS could occupy lot of characters. Hence, we highly recommended using shorten links or tiny URLs in such instances.

7. You can also set the delay in sending SMS from the event time. For example, you want to communicate something to the customer two days post a transaction.\
   i. Click on **Add delay while sending**.\
   ii. Choose your preferred period in the drop-down - Sec, Mins, Hours, or Days.\
   iii. In **Delay by** entering the duration.
