An org can create a new offer or claim an offer.  Offers allow you to define benefits for the loyalty program that is coupon-based. You can use coupons defined in this section only in the Loyalty+ module and you have to incorporate it in Workflows.

<Note title="Note">
Note

Coupon UI is not supported for externally managed coupons. These coupons must be managed via the coupon/series API. Additionally, externally managed coupons do not support uploading coupon codes, as the codes are generated by an external system.
