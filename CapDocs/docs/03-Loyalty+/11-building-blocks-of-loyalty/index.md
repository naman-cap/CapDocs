## Tiers

You can create multiple tiers, automate tier upgrade conditions, and award customers with tiers based on certain conditions set up beforehand. A customer can enjoy certain benefits in each tier as required for the org. For example, you can provide the lowest benefits to customers in the base tier, and increase when they are promoted to a higher tier. Tier upgrade allows you to create new tiers and configure conditions and eligibility criteria.

### Create tiers and configure tier upgrade conditions

To create and configure tiers, follow these steps.

* On Intouch, navigate to Menu > Loyalty+ > Programs.
* In Programs, select the program you want to edit.
* Click Edit Program. 

## Points

You can define conditions for earning points, redeeming points, expiry of points, and returning points.

### Create earn conditions

Earn conditions allow an org to create various conditions and define how a customer can earn points. You can have common points allocation across tiers or different allocations for each tier. For details, see [Create Earn Conditions](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/points#configure-points-earn-conditions).

### Create redeem conditions

Redeem conditions allow you to configure points conversion ratio, eligibility criteria, and limit for points redemption. The eligibility criteria could be based on current points, lifetime points, or lifetime purchases. For details, see [Create Redeem Conditions](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/points#create-redeem-conditions).

### Create expiry conditions

Expiry conditions allow you to set the validity period for points issued through either Loyalty+ or Engage+, and you can also define how these points expire. Points expiry is useful to bring inactive customers back to the store before the validity period of points ends. Expiry conditions are used in tier downgrade, earn condition, redeem conditions and return conditions too. For details, see [Create Expiry Conditions](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/points#expiry-conditions).

### Create return conditions

Return conditions allow an org to define conditions on the reissue of points after a customer returns a transaction or transaction line item. For details, see [Create Return Conditions](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/points#create-return-conditions).
