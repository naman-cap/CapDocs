7. Click **Done**.

## Extend available points to the new cycle

If the expiry condition for reward currency is configured as a **Tier based expiry date**, then points earned in the respective tier will expire when the tier is downgraded or renewed after the renewal check.

Enabling this option allows customers to renew points, which will be renewed along with the tier after the renewal check.
