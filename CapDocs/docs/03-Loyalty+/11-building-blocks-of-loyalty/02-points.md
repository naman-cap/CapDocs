You can define conditions for earning points, redeeming points, expiry of points and returning points.

## Overview

Earn conditions allow an org to create various conditions and define how a customer can earn points. You can have common points allocation across tiers or different allocations for each tier.

<Callout icon="ðŸ“˜" theme="info">
  **Note**

  * For **MLP enabled orgs**, allocation strategies created in a program are associated only with that program and cannot be used even in the org's default program.
  * Capillary does not support converting already allocated redeemable points to non-redeemable points. If you need to remove or suppress redeemable points after allocation (for example, due to double allocation or error), you can use the Manual Points Adjustment[UI](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/points-deductions#manual-points-adjustment)/[API](https://docs.capillarytech.com/reference/deduct-points-and-alternatecurrencies-from-user#/).
</Callout>

### Configure points delay accrual

Delayed accrual allows issuing points to customer for an activity at a later date. For example, if you support item returns, say for a week from the purchase date, you can actually block customers from using those points before the return period. This avoids redundancy and fraud activities.

In Delayed Accrual, points are first issued as promised points. These cannot be redeemed by the customer. After the configured period, these points are converted and credited to the main balance.

In Delayed Accrual, the points allocation date is when points are actually issued to the customer. In the case of Delayed Accrual, the awarded date is when points get added to the current points (accrued date). Refer to the following examples for clarity.

* If a transaction with bill date A is sent to Loyalty EMF on date B, the awarded date is date B.
* If the transactionAdd activity of date A gets replayed on date B, the awarded date is date B.
* If bill points with bill date A are imported on date B, the awarded date is date B.

<Callout icon="ðŸ“˜" theme="info">
  The 'delayed accrual points' are added to the 'current points' on the next morning of the delay period, i.e., (event date + the number of days of delay) specified in the point allocation strategy.

  If a transaction is added on 28th Sep and the number of days of delay is 1, the delayed accrual points will get added to current points on the morning of 30th Sep (morning after 28, Sep + 1 day). The awarded date is 30 Sep.

  You can create rules on the points that are redeemable, non-redeemable, or with the summation of both.
</Callout>

Find the details of event, action, and limitations of Delayed Accrual below -

1. **Event name**: DelayedAccrual. You need to configure the DelayedAccrual activity to perform actions on Delayed Accrual.
2. **Action**: To enable converting promised points to current points, for the DelayedAccrual activity, you need to set **Delayed Accrual Action**.

* **Other actions supported**:
* Send Messages (SMS, Email, Mobile Push)
* Upgrade To Tier
* Issue Coupon
* Delayed Accrual

3. **Limitations**:

* For an activity, you cannot use both direct allocation and delayed accrual strategies. You cannot have strategies with different delay periods. For example, you cannot use one strategy with 4 days delay period and another strategy with 7 days delay period.
* You cannot use **Delayed Accrual** strategies on Registration and Customer Update activities.

## Points unlock ability

By now, it is very clear that brands can give delayed points to their customers from our Loyalty settings (delayed accrual strategy). However, some times brands might want to convert these delayed points also as redeemable points for their customers.

The only way available to do this is via external triggers. Till now, we have this ability only for bill level. But now, we have the ability to do this even on line item levels.

**Some sample use cases:**

1. As a system integrator, I would like to be able to to configure fixed return windows for different line items, allocate promised points on each line item and convert them to redeemable points according to each line itemâ€™s return window, so that the users can get regular points on each line item, as and when the return window for the line items gets over and don't have to wait for the default return windows to get over.
2. As a Loyalty Program Manager, I would like to be able to give my customer an option to end the return window for any transaction or any line item in the transaction and immediately convert promised points to regular points.

You can find more information on how to use this API at below link, please refer.

[Points Unlock API](https://docs.capillarytech.com/reference/points-unlock-api)

## Configure points earn conditions

There are three allocation types available.

* **Fixed**: A fixed number of points is allocated irrespective of the transaction amount.
* **Round Up**: Points are awarded for the gap amount within a defined range. This type can only be used inside Engage+.
* **Prorated**: Points are issued as a percentage of the transaction amount or custom field value and through step function.

Based on the chosen allocation type, you can have the following combinations of points allocation strategies.

* Reward points as a percentage of a transaction amount with the same percentage across tiers. For example - Tier1: 15%, Tier2: 15%.
* Reward points as a percentage of the transaction amount with different percentages for each tier. For example - Tier1: 15% of the transaction amount, Tier2: 20% of the transaction amount.
* Reward a fixed number of points per transaction across tiers. For example - Tier1: 15 points per transaction, Tier2: 15 points per transaction.
* Reward a fixed number of points per transaction with different values across tiers. For example - Tier1: 10 points per transaction, Tier2: 15 points per transaction.
  To configure earning conditions, do the following.
* Reward a fixed number of points in equal step sizes or transaction intervals. For example, allocate 10 points on every spend of Rs.200. So a person doing a transaction of 450 will get 20 points, because his transaction amount lies between 400 - 600.

12. In **Enable Delayed Accrual**, enable the checkbox and enter the days after which the customer is able to redeem points.

* **DELAYED ACCRUAL**: Points are reflected in the customer's account immediately after the transaction but are only redeemable after the prescribed number of days. For example, if an apparel store has a return policy of seven days, and a customer buys a shirt and gets 20 points on this purchase. The points are reflected in the customer's account right after the purchase, but if the customer decides to return the shirt on the third day, the points will disappear from the account and the customer is unable to use the acquired points. Delayed accrual prevents customers from misusing points.

13. Click **Done**.

### Allocate points on custom field values

You can also reward points to your customers based on the custom field values that are submitted on the customer registration and profile update screens of InStore.  This works only for the custom fields with integer values (example: 20) and not for string values (example: John). It is recommended to use a fixed points allocation type for custom fields.

To configure rewarding points based on the custom fields, do the following:

1. In **Earn conditions** click **Add earn condition** to create a new point earning condition (or) to modify an existing condition, navigate to the earn condition and click the respective **edit** button.
2. In **Allocate based** on, choose either **Loyalty Registration** or **Loyalty Transaction** and select your desired custom field accordingly.

3. In the **Allocation type**, choose Fixed to allocate a specific number of points for every transaction (irrespective of the transaction amount). Choose Prorated to allocate points as a percentage of the transaction amount.
4. Click **Done**.

### Configure points round-up for campaigns

Earn condition configuration for Campaigns has an additional Allocation type - Round up. This lets you round up points that are in a specific range for each tier. For example, when running campaigns, you can round up points that are between 30-100 to 100 for all customers in the base tier.

<Callout icon="ðŸ“˜" theme="info">
  If **Same for all Tiers** is disabled, Round up configuration will vary for each tier.
</Callout>

![e9a8da2 0RKh0249iMG Idb  vriWauYmDb D Qz0Q](https://files.readme.io/e9a8da2-0RKh0249iMG-Idb__vriWauYmDb_D_Qz0Q.png)

1. In **Allocation type**, choose _Roundup_.
2. In **Points range**, configure from, to, and round up to the range of points and the value that you want to have for the roundup. For example, if a customer has 40 points (current points) in his/her account and when the campaign is triggered, an additional 60 points will be added to his/her account making it 100 as configured.

### Configure rules for points allocation strategy

Once you create a strategy, you need to configure the relevant activity and define rules based on which you want to execute specific points earning conditions.
Allocation Points is an action that allows you to award points to customers based on certain activities (registration, transaction, profile update, coupon redemption, points redemption, tier upgrade).

**To configure Rules for Points Allocation** :

1. In **Workflow**, go to Customer Activity and click TransactionAdd.
2. In **Select Customer Activity**, choose the activity for which you want to define earn condition rules. While defining actions, you can choose the desired allocation strategy in Earn Condition as shown.

3. You can also set up notifications to send to customers on the successful execution of the activity. Configure SMS, email, WeChat, and/or Mobile Push templates accordingly.

### Configure customer activity for points allocation at the transaction item level

To allocate points at the transaction item level, you need to have a forward case in which the transaction item is enabled. To issue points on a transaction item based on the item price enable **Use proportions**.

<Callout icon="ðŸ“˜" theme="info">
  * Transaction item is available only for forward cases (Forward to set action).
  * **Use proportions** and **Maximize point allocation** options are visible only after you enable **Enable transaction item**.
</Callout>

1. **Enable transaction item**: Enable this option to issue points at the line-item level.
2. **Use proportions**: Enable this option to split points according to the price of transaction items. For example, consider a transaction with a bill amount of $300 consisting of two line items lineitem1 of $100, and lineitem2 of $200. If points allocation is 10% of the transaction amount, then 10 points will be issued for lineitem1 and 20 for lineitem2.
3. **Maximize point allocation**: Enable this option to set a cap on points allocated to customers.
4. **Enable tender unroller**: Enable this option to configure rules on payment modes.

### Limit points issual per customer for each set

You can limit points issued to customers on transaction amount, line-item amount, and tracker value for each set and subset separately per customer.

<Callout icon="ðŸ“˜" theme="info">
  * After adding and deleting the capping value, click **Save**.

## Create redeem conditions

Redeem conditions allow you to configure points conversion ratio, eligibility criteria, and limit for points redemption. The eligibility criteria could be current points, lifetime points, or lifetime purchases.

You can configure points redemption to do the following.

* Set-point conversion ratio
* Define the minimum points a customer should earn.
* Limit the number of points redemption per transaction.
* Redeem points in multiples of 'X'.

##### Example

* Customers need at least 150-lifetime points to be eligible for redeeming points
* Redemption is allowed only in multiples of 50, and
* A maximum of 100 points can be redeemed per transaction
* At least one redemption strategy should be created in a loyalty program. An error is shown if you run the loyalty program without any points redemption strategy.
* For MLP, points redemption strategies created in a program cannot be used in other org programs, not even in the org's default program.

**To configure redeem conditions, do the following** -

1. On **Intouch**, navigate to **Menu** > **Loyalty+** > **Programs**.
2. In **Programs**, select the program you want to edit.
3. Click **Edit Program**
4. Click **Points**.
5. In **How much is each point worth?**, specify the points conversion ratio (in terms of org's base currency). It is recommended to use a simple conversion ratio such as 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.75,1.

## Create return conditions

Return conditions allow an org to define conditions on the reissue of points after a customer returns a transaction or transaction line item.

Points are returned in two ways as explained in the following.

Reverse points
Reissue Points
Also see:

Configure customer activity for points reversal

Reverse points
You can reverse the redeemed points, such that the points expiry for those points is restored to the original. There are some configurations for points reversal depending on the reference transaction number.

Redemption without reference transaction number: If redemption is made without any transaction number then you can reverse points on the basis of redemption ID using the option Redemption reference captured in the bill. Points expiry for reversed points is restored to the original without altering the expiry date.
Redemption with reference transaction number: If redemption is made with transaction number then you can reverse points on the basis of redemption ID using the option Redemption reference captured in the bill. Points expiry for reversed points is restored to the original without altering the expiry date.
Prerequisites for points reversal support
Enable Allow_points_redemption_reversal config on EMF settings. Only the back-end team has access to this page. Please raise a ticket if you want this to enable.
Enable V2 API as points reversal is supported only in V2.0.
Enable Redemption reference captured in the bill on Points Return (Loyalty+)page.
Reissue Points
In a case where no transaction or redemption reference number is available, you can reissue points and set an expiry strategy. Hence, reissued points will have a new expiry date.

To configure points return, follow these steps.

On Intouch, navigate to Menu > Loyalty+ > Programs.
In Programs, select the program you want to edit.
Click Edit Program
Click Points.
Click Add Return Conditions.

Enable Return Used Points.

In Return used points based on, select any of the following options based on which points are returned.
Points tender mode: To reissue redeemed points in form of currency relevant for the org. You need to set the expiry strategy for the reissued points in Select expiry strategy for reissued points.
Redemption Reference in the Bill: To reverse redeemed points with the redemption reference number captured in the transaction. The expiry strategy will also be reversed to the original.
Bill Number in Redemption API: When a customer returns a transaction for which certain points are redeemed, it is required to return those redeemed points. Hence, to reverse points, you need to configure the reference number to be considered for redemption.

In Expiry condition for returned points., define how reissued points will expire for the chosen return method.
Click Done.
Configure customer activity for points reversal
In Customer Activity, two actions are supported for points reversal - 1. Reverse points and 2. Send message.

To configure events for points reversal, follow these steps.

In Workflow, go to Customer Activity and click TransactionAdd.
Select Redeemed points get reversed.

In Condition, leave the Expression and Expression equals to default - true. No rules are applicable for points reversal.
In Points redemption reversal action, leave Points Expiry to the default option. This will return the expiry of the reverse points to the original expiry.
In Channels, set the message you want to send to customers for points reversal. For more details on channel configuration, see Communications.

## Advanced settings for points

### Points round off settings

You can define the number of decimal points up to which points can be issued or withdrawn from a customer. This is applicable for [issued points](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/points), [returned points](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/points#create-return-conditions), [re-evaluated points](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/january-february-march23#re-evaluation-of-return-in-the-event-of-earn-capping), [delayed accrual points](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/points#configure-points-delayed-accrual), line-item allocation, issued and re-evaluated points on line items, [manual points adjustments](https://docs.capillarytech.com/reference/deduct-points-and-alternatecurrencies-from-user) and [points redemption](https://docs.capillarytech.com/reference/points-redemption).

For example, 50.3458 points have to be issued to a customer. The following table highlights the points that will be issued based on the round off setting configured. The rounding strategy is round half-up (default).

| Round Decimals value | 0  | 1    | 2     | 3      |
| :------------------- | :- | :--- | :---- | :----- |
| Points issued        | 50 | 50.3 | 50.35 | 50.346 |

To configure points round-of settings, follow these steps:

1. On **Intouch**, navigate to **Menu** > Loyalty+ > **Programs**.
2. In **Programs**, select the program for which you want to set the points round-off setting and click **Edit Program** > **Advanced settings**.

![9886a3318c6fc80d69b6b9335bd1ce6a47163c0083fa5537a28a61ebecef8281 image](https://files.readme.io/9886a3318c6fc80d69b6b9335bd1ce6a47163c0083fa5537a28a61ebecef8281-image.png)

3. Navigate to the **Points** page.
4. Choose the decimal places using the drop-down list under **Round off decimal earnings by**. By default, the system stores the values up to 3 decimal places.

   ![46398dee4da6f09fbfef8a4bee1742e8ce682a2c1b911c30e8fc16cceacbcce1 image](https://files.readme.io/46398dee4da6f09fbfef8a4bee1742e8ce682a2c1b911c30e8fc16cceacbcce1-image.png)
5. Navigate to the Points page.

### Reward currency rounding strategy

You can define the strategy for rounding off reward currencies. Based on the number of decimals configured, the rounding is considered up to those decimal places. For example, if the round-off is set to two decimal places, the rounding would be for the nearest hundredths.

The types of strategies for rounding are as follows:

1. **Ceiling**: Rounds numbers towards positive infinity. Positive numbers round-up, while negative numbers round down (towards zero).
2. **Floor**: Rounds numbers towards negative infinity. Positive numbers round down, while negative numbers round down.
3. **Round Half Up**: Rounds to the nearest value, rounding up when the next digit is five or more.  If the decimal is 5 (midway), then it is rounded up.
4. **Round Half Down**: Rounds to the nearest value, rounding up when the next digit is five or more.  If the decimal is 5 (midway), then it is rounded down.
5. **Round Half Even**: Rounds to the nearest value, rounding to the nearest even number when the next digit is exactly five.

For example, 25.8751 points are to be allocated to a customer and the round-off is set to two decimal places, The following table highlights the value of points that will be issued based on the round off strategy:

| Round Strategy            | Ceiling | Floor | Half Up (Default) | Half Down | Half Even |
| :------------------------ | :------ | :---- | :---------------- | :-------- | :-------- |
| Points round-up (25.8751) | 25.88   | 25.87 | 25.88             | 25.87     | 25.88     |

To configure the points round-of strategy, follow these steps:

1. On **Intouch**, navigate to **Menu** > Loyalty+ > **Programs**.
2. In **Programs**, select the program for which you want to set the points round-off setting and click **Edit Program** > **Advanced settings**.

3. Navigate to the **Points** page.
4. Choose the points rounding strategy using the drop-down list under **Currency rounding strategy for decimal conversion**. that appears on the earn conditions. By default, the system rounds half up.

### Rolling points expiry when no points are issued

Points rolling expiry is a feature that resets or extends the expiry date of loyalty points when a customer performs certain actions, such as making a transaction or redeeming points. Refer to the documentation for more information on [points rolling expiry](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/points-rolling-expiry).

By default, the rolling expiry process only considers points with a value greater than zero. If a customer performs a rolling event and receives no points for it, the system will not consider the rolling event even if it is valid, and the expiry window is not extended. To consider rolling when no points are earned, you can enable **Roll the expiry even when 0 points are given** to ensure that it is considered for extending the expiry.

For example:
A retail loyalty program configures points earned to expire after 12 months unless they engage in a rolling event to extend the expiry.

A customer earns 100 points in January 2024, with a 12-month rolling expiry (set to expire in January 2025).

Now, in December 2024, the customer purchases as part of a special promotion. However, this promotion does not award any new points (zero points are awarded).

**When disabled:**

* Since the promotion awards zero points, it is ignored by the rolling expiry.
* The customerâ€™s **100 points still expire in January 2025**.

**When enabled:**

* The system recognizes the **zero-point award purchase as a valid rolling event**.
* The **expiry date of the 100 points is extended to December 2025**.
