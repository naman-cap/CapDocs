The Workflow Simulation feature empowers brands to simulate events and evaluate the potential rewards or points linked to these events. It provides a platform for brands to simulate diverse scenarios, allowing them to demonstrate the benefits that customers can attain through each event.

# Use cases:

* **Engaging unregistered customers:** One of the primary applications of the Workflow Simulation API is to engage and motivate unregistered customers. By Illustrating the potential advantages of participating in a loyalty program, it encourages these customers to register and become part of the program.
* **Enhancing registered customer engagement:** For registered customers, an event simulation demonstrates how their purchasing decisions, such as buying additional items or higher-priced products, can positively impact their rewards. This information serves as an incentive for users to make choices that may not have been considered otherwise.

**Note:** At present, simulation is only supported for Transaction Add (Regular).
