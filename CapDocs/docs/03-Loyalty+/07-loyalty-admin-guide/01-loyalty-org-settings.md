## Communication Settings

Channel settings help increase productivity by reaching out to customers based on your org's preferred channel (mandatory) and other channels based on customers'  availability in the order of priority. This can also minimize the cost of communication by reaching out to cheap communication channels and maximize the probability of conversion by prioritizing channels that could give better ROI.

#### To configure communication settings, follow these steps.

1. Log in to **Intouch**, navigate to **Menu** > **Loyalty+** > **Programs**.
2. In **Programs**, select the program for which you want to set the communication setting and click **Edit Program** > **Advanced settings**.

3) In the **Communication Channels**, enable the **Setup Communication** toggle button to set mandatory channels and priority channels.

* **Mandatory Channels**: Channels that are mandatory for sending the notifications
* **Priority Channels**: Channels that need to be triggered based on priority and availability. For example, if Mobile is set as priority 1, Mobile Push as priority 2, and email as priority 3, the system first checks whether SMS is configured and then checks if the mobile number is available for the customer. If anyone fails, then it will try to send the notification through mobile push and so on.

**Example**\
Consider for a tier upgrade event, SMS is set as a Mandatory Channel and the priority channels are email (1) and WeChat (2). When a tier is upgraded for the customers mentioned in the following table, notifications are sent based on the channel availability and configuration settings as explained below.
