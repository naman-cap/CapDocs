You can find APIs for linking, updating and delinking customers and to view customer history with partner and supplementary programs [here](https://capillary.github.io/api-documentation/#link-partner-program).

You also need to check "ENABLE\_PARTNER\_PROGRAM\_LINKING" and "ENABLE\_TIER\_DOWNGRADE\_ON\_PARTNER\_PROGRAM\_EXIPRY" as Active and put an integer value in "SUPPLEMENTARY\_PARTNER\_PROGRAM\_LIMIT" in the emf settings to make partner or supplementary program work.
