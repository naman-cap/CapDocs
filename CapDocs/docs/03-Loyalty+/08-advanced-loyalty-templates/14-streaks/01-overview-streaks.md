A streak refers to a consecutive series of actions or engagements by a customer, based on which loyalty benefits are provided. The concept of a streak emphasizes the continuity and consistency of customer behavior over time, often leading to rewards or incentives from the loyalty program.

For example, in a retail loyalty program, a streak may involve a customer making purchases on consecutive days, weeks, or months. Each consecutive action contributes to the customer's streak, and as the streak continues, the customer may unlock additional rewards, bonuses, or higher loyalty tiers.

For any brand, having a large loyal customer base is an advantage. A loyal customer base can help you create a recurring revenue flow, a reputation in the market, an organic way of getting new users because of strong word-of-mouth, etc... We have many capabilities like loyalty promotions, milestones, campaigns, etc... to achieve that.

Some of the popular streak use cases present in the market:

1. **Streak in social media apps:** A user has to share a story or post every day to maintain streak value. The higher the streak value, the more bragging visibility it gives to the user.
2. **Streaks in education apps:** A user has to learn continuously / qualify in a test continuously to earn rewards.
3. **Streaks in e-commerce:** A user has to open the app 10 times a week for 4 weeks to get 10 points. A user has to provide 1 review in a month for 6 months to get exclusive access to rewards. 
4. **Streaks in health & fitness:** A user has to walk 5k steps in a day for 10 days to get 1% off on insurance premiums. A user has to drink 3 liters of water per day for 30 days to get 100 points.
5. and many many more.

With the Streaks feature in Capillary loyalty programs, you can give some specific tasks to your users and make them do them continuously to get the rewards. This will lead to:

1. A user base that does specified activity (like purchases, interactions, etc..) continuously.
2. A recurring source of revenue
3. Increased user retention.

# Sample streak use cases in loyalty

* A user has to purchase 1000 gross sales from the electronics category in a week. If the user does this continuously for five weeks, 10 weeks, and 15 weeks, then the user will get 10, 50, and 100 points.
* A user has to log into the brand's mobile application five times a month from their mobile. If the user does this continuously for three months or five months, then the user will get a $2, or $5 coupon.
* A user has to refer three new customers in a quarter. If the user does this continuously for two quarters or three quarters, then the user will get a silver badge or a gold badge.
* A user has to drink at least one coffee (say Espresso) every day. If the user does this for five days, 10 days, or 15 days continuously, then the user will get 5 stars, 10 stars, and 15 stars. 

# Streaks Vs Milestones

Streaks and Milestones are both powerful gamification capabilities that share common advantages such as increasing user retention, revenue, cross-sales, and incentivization. However, they differ significantly in how they reward a user. Therefore, understanding when to use each capability is essential.

| Streaks work across cycles. This means the user has to do something continuously across cycles.                          | Milestones work on the cycle level. So users can achieve them independently.            |
