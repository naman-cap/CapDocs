Subscription programs (previously called supplementary programs ) are small and segmented loyalty programs that run along with loyalty programs but for a shorter span. An org can create any number of subscription programs. These can be paid or unpaid programs. These programs have incentives or benefits over and above the basic loyalty program to incentivize more loyal customers better.
