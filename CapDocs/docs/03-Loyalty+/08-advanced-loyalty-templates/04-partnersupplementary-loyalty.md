Partner programs are loyalty programs of the Org that are created outside Capillary. Loyalty+ supports syncing tiers of partner programs and adding customers to the program. This basically means that two or more brands can collaborate to give incentives to customers. Here the burden of the incentive cost is divided between the brands and the customer can become loyal to all these brands at once. For example, a car manufacturer and an insurance company can come together to give incentives to customers for picking them together.

Supplementary programs are small and segmented loyalty programs that run along with loyalty programs but for a shorter span. An org can create any number of supplementary programs. These can be paid or unpaid programs. These programs have incentives or benefits over and above the basic loyalty program to better incentivize the more loyal customers.

Benefits of Subscription Loyalty:

* Personalized and segmented incentives from Day 1
* Extra revenue generated by brand due to the subscription fee
* Always-on offers for the customers
* Rewards drive conversion and engagement
* Accurate attribution to programs, increased AOV and retention

4. Click **Create**.

## Inside Workflows

Right now, the linking and delinking of customers is supported through the Activities: TransactionAdd, CustomerRegistration, CouponRedemption, TransactionUpdate, TargetCompleted and the behavioral events that you create. In each of these, you can create rules saying the customer would be included in the supplementary or partner program (you can create an SKU for the membership fee and create a rule saying that this SKU should be included in the customer's basket).

The Action to be used here is the "Initiate Supplementary Membership Action".

* You need to select the Partner Program from the list.
* Select Tier Action from the options: Slab Upgrade, Renew Slab, No Action.
* You can also configure Communication for this here.

You can also achieve the use case where the customer reaches a certain milestone and then they are taken into the program. This can be achieved using Targets. In the TargetCompleted Event, you can find the same Action as above and then follow the same steps as above in addition to writing a respective rule.

## Program Settings

Here, you can enable the "One Customer One Scheme" toggle to make sure that one customer is only linked to one supplementary program at any point of time. 

You can also check "Auto-delink Customer From the Current Scheme when Linking to Another" to directly take them out of the previously joined program. If this is not enabled, the system would just give an error saying this customer is already enrolled in (name) program.

## Limiting Cart Promotions to certain Supplementary Programs

If your brand has opted for Cart Promotions with their loyalty program, you can limit the cart promotions to be offered only to the customers of the supplementary programs. To do this:

1. Go to Engage+> Cart Promotions
2. Select POS Promotions
3. After setting up the promotion, go to scope
4. In scope, you can limit the promotion to different types of customers, here, select the supplementary program in question

## Integrations

You can find APIs for linking, updating and delinking customers and to view customer history with partner and supplementary programs [here](https://capillary.github.io/api-documentation/#link-partner-program).

You also need to check "ENABLE\_PARTNER\_PROGRAM\_LINKING" and "ENABLE\_TIER\_DOWNGRADE\_ON\_PARTNER\_PROGRAM\_EXIPRY" as Active and put an integer value in "SUPPLEMENTARY\_PARTNER\_PROGRAM\_LIMIT" in the emf settings to make partner or supplementary program work.

## Ability to delete a linked promotion & removal of benefits limits from the new UI of coalition (partner) & supplementary (subscription) programs.

As of now, both in coalition & subscription programs creation flow, there is an option called ‚ÄúBenefits Limit‚Äù which users have to configure while configuring them. Basically, this is to put a limit on the amount of benefits/loyalty promotions customers can get from either coalition or subscription programs.

Also, earlier if one promotion is linked to a subscription or coalition program, it cannot be deleted. The coalition or subscription program has to end, to end the promotion linked with the program.

Now, we have made 2 new enhancements in the new UI of coalition and subscription programs where the above issues won‚Äôt be there.

**Enhancement made:**

1. Benefits limit option is removed, as the limit will be already configured in the loyalty promotion itself. Whatever limit that previously used to stay here won‚Äôt matter, as that will always be overridden by the restrictions configured in the loyalty promotions.
2. Now when a loyalty promotion/benefit is linked to a coalition or subscription program, that can be deleted very easily by clicking on the delete icon along each benefit.
