Customer Authentication is a Auth Engine framework that manages end-user (customer) authentication to the organizationâ€™s mobile or web application. This resource provides APIs related to authenticating web and mobile applications.

The authentication completes only after validating the mobile number or email ID through OTP.

Before starting with the Auth Engine APIs, you need to know the following backend configurations.

* Whether the password option is enabled for the org if you want to use password-based authentication.
* Whether OTP is enabled for the org and the daily limit of OTPs a customer can generate. If you need to increase the daily limit of OTPs a customer can generate in a day, log a request and assign it to the Platforms team.

Here we have provided only the details of Auth Engine APIs.

See more details about [Auth Engine or User Authentication](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/configure-authentication-settings).
