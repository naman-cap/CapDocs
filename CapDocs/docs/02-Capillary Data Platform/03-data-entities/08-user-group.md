## Introduction

A user group comprises individuals in a hierarchical order who belong to a particular organisation. An individual can belong to multiple user groups. An organisation can designate different roles to these members and incentivise them according to the organisationâ€™s preference. User group loyalty allows an organisation to incentivise not only its customers but also other business entities or individuals that contribute to their profits. It is a customer retention solution with custom group structures and includes generic loyalty mechanics which help an organisation to establish brand loyalty.

In user group loyalty, an individualâ€™s (member of a group) action will lead to other group members being rewarded.

For example, if a fleet driver fills petrol from BPCL, the manager of the fleet group can receive points for the transaction. This way of incentivising the upper management encourages other members of the group to transact with an organisation.

### Key concepts
