## Introduction

This topic provides information to admin users on how to modify their profile information and change the language for their InTouch account.

Even though there is a language setting option at an organization level, admin users are provided with the privilege to see the Capillary applications of their account in the language they prefer. 

For example, if your organization's language is set to Chinese and for your account, as an admin user), the language is set to English, then you will see the applications of your account in English irrespective of your organization's language. However, only admin users have this privilege.

### To modify your profile information and language:

2. Click the **Settings** icon and then click **Organization Setup**. The category expands showing the available options.
