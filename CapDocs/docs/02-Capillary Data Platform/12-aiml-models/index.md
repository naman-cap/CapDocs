## Overview of AI dashboard

AI models dashboard is Capillary’s platform to run machine learning models. The dashboard offers self-serve personalization with several models available out-of-the box.  It allows you to launch models for your org in just a few clicks and leverage valuable inferences from them.

The dashboard abstracts the complexity of data science and makes machine learning models easily accessible to analysts. You can make business decisions based on the insights provided by the model. Since, processing and making inferences on data present in large volumes cannot be handled manually, machine learning provides an intuitive solution to the problem. The dashboard closely works on the principles of machine learning operations (MLOps). MLOps streamlines the data science outreach for an organization.

## Benefits of AI dashboard

The dashboard aims to address the following benefits for running and managing machine learning models efficiently.

## Ready availability of machine learning models

The dashboard fosters model discovery with all existing and upcoming models available on the dashboard. To know the list of models that can be used for running personalization campaigns, for example, brand users need not rely on Capillary Customer Success (CS) teams.

## Seamless integration with Capillary application

Once the models go live on the dashboard, the results (predictions) can be utilized in Engage+ as filters to run personalized campaigns.

Likewise, users of Insights+ can leverage live models to generate reports that depict vital statistics. 

All model results can be visualized on Insights+ reports. However, the Insights+ team needs to setup KPIs for the reports to view results.

## Improved productivity

The dashboard has been designed with the goal of making Artificial Intelligence (AI) self-serve. A marketer looking to run a personalized, churn killer campaign, for instance, need not rely on internal data science teams. Capillary’s Insights+ team intervention is also not required.

With the dashboard, the marketer can leverage the relevant model while utilizing predictions to run personalized campaigns. There is no productivity loss as there is no dependency on internal or external teams.

## Easy management

The dashboard provides a timely management of the machine learning models that an organization deploys. The dashboard validates and trains the model regularly in periodic intervals to ensure that predictions are accurate and based on recent data.

| :--------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Transaction Propensity       | 1. The high propensity customers can be encouraged to try products that have been newly launched. Orgs can identify the customers that are most likely to transact in the next 30 days using the transaction propensity model and target these customers with specific campaigns.  2. Orgs can also identify the customers that are least likely to transact in the next 30 days and exclude them from campaigns.  3. Product preferences of customers who are most likely to transact in the next 30 days can be analyzed using Insights+. Use results generated by models in Insights+ for reports. |
| Customer Churn Prediction    | 1. Orgs can identify the customers who are likely to churn in the next 30 days and these customers can be targeted with aggressive churn killer campaigns.  2. Customers who are least likely to churn can be targeted with informational campaigns (instead of aggressive, personalized offers) to keep them engaged.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Campaign Response Prediction | 1. Orgs can identify customers who are most likely to respond to a campaign. For instance, customers not likely to respond to a festive campaign can be excluded and campaign costs can be saved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| CLTV Prediction              | 1. Orgs can identify the most valuable customers for the brand using the CLTV Prediction model. Orgs can create an exclusive experience for such customers. 2. Orgs can identify the customers with low CLTV value and offer them loyalty services or additional discounts to upscale their value. 3. Orgs can use a combination of CLTV prediction and churn prediction models to arrest churn of high value customers.                                                                                                                                                                              |

### New terminologies in AI/ML

| Terminology                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :-------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Accuracy**                            | It is the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions made. Accuracy highlights the rate of accurate model prediction.                                                                                                 |
| **Accuracy Metrics**                    | Accuracy metrics indicate numerical values that evaluate the performance of the model.                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Data validation**                     | It is to check the accuracy and quality of the source data before training. It ensures that the mistakes are addressed and not silently ignored.                                                                                                    |
| **Dataset**                             | A set of data available in a tabular format is called a dataset. It is the set of data processed in a machine to make the predictions.                                                                                                              |
| **F1 score**                            | It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, taking both metrics into account.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)** | MLOps is a set of best practices that seamlessly brings data science solutions into existing systems. Enterprises can set up efficient data science solutions without disturbing their current set up.                                              |
| **Machine learning model**              | A machine learning model is a mathematical representation of a set of data and is used to make predictions/inferences. There are several types of machine learning models available and the models offer unique advantages for different use cases. |
| **Model training**                      | A data science model needs to be trained with available data to make effective predictions on newer data. A machine learning algorithm learns from a dataset and predicts results for a different set of data.                                      |
| **Precision**                           | The ability of a classification model to identify only the relevant data points.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Re-training**                         | Any model will decay as time elapses and new data keeps coming in. Consequently, deployed models would need retraining at certain intervals. Re-training with newer data increases the prediction accuracy in the longer run.                       |
| **Recall**                              | The ability of a model to find all the relevant cases within a dataset.                                                                                                                                                                             |

## Data models

The AI/ML dashboard uses machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in the background. The dashboard models are named as per their functionality, for instance, if a model predicts when a customer is likely to make a transaction, it is titled ‘Transaction prediction’.

The propensity models of dashboard are described in the following table -

| Model                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                   | More Info.                                                                                                                                                     |
| :--------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Transaction prediction       | The Transaction prediction predicts customers who all are likely to purchase in the future time period - 30 days.                                                                             | The Transaction prediction model uses a binary classifier composing a primary ensemble of Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and Random Forest.       |
| Customer Churn Prediction    | The Customer Churn Prediction predicts customers who have a high chance of churning.                                                                                                          | The Customer Churn Prediction model uses a binary classifier composing a primary ensemble of Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and Random Forest.    |
| Campaign Response Prediction | The Campaign Response Prediction is very specific to a certain campaign period and given a campaign who would respond. This also takes the previous response rate of the person into account. | The Campaign Response Prediction model uses a binary classifier composing a primary ensemble of Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and Random Forest. |
| CLTV Prediction              | The CLTV Prediction predicts the customer lifetime value for a year and then extrapolates for the next 3 years.                                                                               | The CLTV Prediction model uses a combination of regression and bucketing based classification algorithms.                                                      |
| Product Affinity             | The Product Affinity ranks the product in the order of choice of the customer.                                                                                                                | The Product Affinity model uses the Proximity Model and FIR score Model.                                                                                       |

## Add model

The dashboard offers several models related to retail and you can leverage them for analysis. There are five models available currently on AIRA. You need to add models manually to your org according to the business requirement.

There are four steps involved for an org to use a model.

### Initiate model

You can either select a new model offered by Capillary or work on [pending](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/view-details-of-a-model) models that have been initiated.

To select a new model, use the following steps.

1. On the AIRA Dashboard page, click New model. 
2. Choose a relevant model and click on Initiate. The model is initiated and its status/sub-status changes to Not Initiated/Disabled. Then, proceed to  Step 2: Validate Data.

![374d4f0 m2](https://files.readme.io/374d4f0-m2.png)

### Validate data

Once you initiate a model, you need to validate the data to ensure the data is proper without any errors.

To validate the data, 

* Navigate to the Validate tab, click Validate. You will see this only if the the validation is pending for the model. 

![](https://files.readme.io/b290089-9.png "9.png")

Data validation triggers and the status/sub-status of the model changes to **In Progress/Validating**. 

When the validation is completed, the status changes to **User Action Required/Ready for Training**. You can proceed to Step 3: Train Model.

![](https://files.readme.io/1a4ed9c-8.png "8.png")

* User Action Required/ Data Quality: Needs Attention: The status or sub-status of the model when the data validation has failed. You can see the reason why the data validation has failed along with the recommended solution.

* Successful validation report: When the data is validated successfully, you will see the summary of the data quality as shown here. 

![10491bf DataQualityReport](https://files.readme.io/10491bf-DataQualityReport.png)

* When the data validation is not successful, you will see an exhaustive report that helps identify root causes of failure such as scarcity of historical data or insufficient number of campaigns. 

### Train model

You need to train the model after the dataset validation is successful. The training process usually takes less than a day.

* To train a model, navigate to the **Training** tab and click **Train**. The status/sub-status of your model changes to In **Progress/Training**. 

![f0c49f8 4](https://files.readme.io/f0c49f8-4.png)

If validation has failed for the model, you will see a note to fix validation issued (as shown in the screenshot)

![403050f 3](https://files.readme.io/403050f-3.png)

When the model training has been successfully completed, you will see a screen in your Training tab similar to the below screenshot.

![06b19b7 2](https://files.readme.io/06b19b7-2.png)

You can view the descriptions of the fields of Training tab, see the following sections. 

### Check data accuracy

A model’s performance decays with time (with the availability of new data) and if the accuracy metrics downgrade, you must re-train the model.

If the model has not completed all the previous stages, then the Accuracy tab shows a message conveying that no data is available for accuracy.

When all the phases have been completed successfully, the model goes live! The status/sub-status of the model changes to Live/Monitoring Accuracy.

You can view the descriptions of the fields of Accuracy tab in the View model details section.

## View model details

There are two ways by which you can search for a model (as depicted in the following screenshot).

1. **Search models by model name:** Use the Search box to search for your preferred model. You will start seeing the models as you type.
2. **Filter models by status:** By default the table shows the list of all models. You can filter models by a specific status. For example, see only Live models. Use the available drop-down box and select your preferred status to view.
