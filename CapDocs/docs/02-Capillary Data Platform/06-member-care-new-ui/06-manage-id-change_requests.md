After a deletion request is raised for a customer, their status changes to **Deletion Pending**. The member account is deleted only after the deletion request is approved. 

For more information on member account deletion request configuration and request statuses, refer to [PII deletion configuration](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/pii-configuration).

## Merge Accounts

When duplicate accounts of a customer exist, you can merge those accounts into one. One account will be retained, and the other account will be removed.

**\*Surviving Account**: The customer account that will continue to exist after the accounts are merged is referred to as the Surviving Account.\
**Deactivating Account / Victim account**: The customer account that will be removed after merging is referred to as a deactivating account. Once deactivated, this account cannot be reactivated, and its data cannot be retrieved. Except for Behavioural events and requests, all other data is transferred to the survivor account.
