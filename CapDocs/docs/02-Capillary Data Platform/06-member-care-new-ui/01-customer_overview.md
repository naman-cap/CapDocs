## Source profiles

This page shows the customer registration sources in multiple tabs. Capillary supports different sources such as InStore, Facebook, Webengage, WeChat (China-specific), mobile app websites, Line, TMALL, E-commerce sites, WhatsApp, and more.\
By default, InStore is set as the default source. There are also sources such as Mobile Push, Facebook, and WeChat that can have multiple accounts within the org. You can see the customer details from each account of the source.

![a8a2028 Customer source](https://files.readme.io/a8a2028-Customer_source.png)

For example, in the above image, you can see numbers on top of the profile icons. The number 3 on the Whatsapp icon means that the customer has profiles from three WhatsApp accounts of the org. You can click on the Whatsapp icon and choose between one of the three profiles that you want to see.

## Customer status and name

This section shows the current status (custom status label or fraud status) of the customer, the name, and the date when the customer registered. The customer status setting is not by default enabled for an org, its enabled only on a request from the Success team.

![ecda604 Customer status](https://files.readme.io/ecda604-Customer_status.png)

All orgs might not have Customer Status enabled. Hence, you would see Fraud Status (default enabled) for orgs that have not enabled Customer Status. The *Fraud Status* is the legacy version of *Customer Status*.

Fraud status contains predefined values (MARKED, CONFIRMED, NOT\_FRAUD, RECONFIRMED, INTERNAL), unlike Customer label which contains user-defined values (called custom labels).

This remains blank when Both Customer Status and Fraud Status are not set for the customer.

You can also see the Status card available in the overview tab.

![bb7ddd7 Status](https://files.readme.io/bb7ddd7-Status.png)

Here you can see the following statuses of the customer:

* **Loyalty status**: Displays the loyalty status. For example, Loyal.
* **Test & control status**: You can also change the current group of customers from test to control or vice versa. Click on the more options icon > Change test and control status > In **Change to**, set the new status.
* **Customer status code**:  Defines the current customer status in the Capillary system.
* **Customer status label**: Defines the customer status.   To change the customer status label, click on the more options icon > **Change customer status label** >  **Change to**, choose the new status >  **Reason** , type the reason or notes for updating the status label > Click **Save**.
