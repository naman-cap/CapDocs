Generally speaking, there needs to be certain velocity limits or rules which should apply to points transfer functionality. As of now, there are no such restrictions, and anyone can transfer any number of points to another user or user group. This can lead to unwanted fraudulent activities.

Let's understand with a use case:

As a brand manager, I want to apply velocity limits in transferring of points so that I can configure additional layers to prevent misuse of the points by transfer.

**For examples:**\
If a brand manager wants to restrict the points transfer limit to max 200 points per day and max number of transfers to 2 times only for a program.

These above restrictions helps brands in preventing unfair activities by the customers to gain rewards. With this enhancement, this ability to restrict feature exists both for Group Points transfer and Individual points transfer, for those brands using Group Loyalty set-ups. So there can be 4 combinations of points transfer in case of group loyalty:

* Individual → Group
* Group → Individual
* Individual → Individual
* Group → Group

### Now, brands can define:

**Points transfer limit**: for daily (For a day) , Weekly (Past 7 days), and Monthly( Past 30 days). Eg - Users cannot transfer more than 500 points from one account to another in a day.\
**The frequency of Point transfer**: for daily (For a day) , Weekly (Past 7 days), and Monthly( Past 30 days). Eg - Users cannot transfer points more than 3 times from one account to another in a day.
