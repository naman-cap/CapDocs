# Introduction

Retroactive transactions or Retro transactions are those transactions that are applied to a loyalty program account after the transaction has taken place. This can occur due to a number of factors such as an error in the transaction process, a delay in the transaction being recorded, or a promotion being applied retroactively to a past purchase. Retro transaction allows brands to choose the date to be followed for retro transactions as per their policies.

> ðŸ“˜ To enable retro transactions for your org, contact the Capillary sustenance team.

# Handling retro transactions

Capillary handles retro transactions based on the date of the transaction as well as the date of processing. A not-interested transaction can be tagged to the respective customer when the customer registers into the loyalty program within the window period.

For instance, if a customer took a flight on March 20th but did not provide loyalty details on that date and later reached out to the airlineâ€™s customer care to obtain loyalty points, the transaction date is March 20th, and the date on which the loyalty points are processed becomes the date of processing.

To avail of the airline rewards, the customer can provide flight and loyalty program account information to the airline. The airline then tags the transaction and awards the reward to the customer based on the date of transaction or date of processing.

# Configuring the window period for retro transaction

To customize the retro transaction window, perform the following:

1. Navigate to **Organisation settings**.
2. Navigate to **Systems & Deployment** > **Intouch POS Configuration** >  **Billing** .

4. To configure buffer time, in the `CONF_CLIENT_RETRO_DELAY_SINCE_REGISTRATION_HOURS` set the value of your choice.

For instance, if the value is set to 3, the customer registering at 9:00 AM will be able to claim loyalty points for a non-interested transaction with billing times later than 6:00 AM but not before 5:59 AM.
