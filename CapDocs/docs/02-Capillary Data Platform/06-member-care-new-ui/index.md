> *   Switching behavior is applicable only for **Search** > **Customer** and CSV pages. Once you switch to the old UI, everything else will work as it is.

To enable this config, create a ticket to the Capillary Product Support Team. This configuration is not applicable for the Old Member Care UI.

## Sharing old UI profile link

You can share the old UI customer profile link directly. To share, use the url *\{host}/memberCare/search/Customer?oldFlow=true*.

For example, [https://eucrm.cc.capillarytech.com/memberCare/search/Customer?id=172076358\&oldFlow=true](https://eucrm.cc.capillarytech.com/memberCare/search/Customer?id=172076358\&oldFlow=true)

> ‚ùóÔ∏è You must use oldFlow=true parameter to directly navigate to the old UI search page. If you use the same URL without the oldFlow parameter, you will be redirected to the new Customer Search page.
