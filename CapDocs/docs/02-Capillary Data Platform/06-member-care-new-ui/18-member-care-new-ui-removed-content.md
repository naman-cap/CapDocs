We put some fresh paint to Member Care, starting with the most frequently used component - the Customer Single View (CSV) page. The new design of the CSV page offers a cleaner and better-organized view of customer information providing an intuitive user experience.

### Improvements

The new UI brings in consistency with other Capillary products with the following improvements.

* Reduced cognitive load as information is presented in an organized, progressive manner.
* Designed with the view of enabling customization in the future.
* A persistent left side bar highlighting key aspects of a customer's profile such as sources, identifiers, loyalty slab information and recent events.
* New, easy to access pages for viewing loyalty information, customer events, incentives and interactions.
* Better visualization of points data using the recently launched [Ledger API](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VyKPazJ-hzOWIxP-PA4bz0UrzRI5-LOaQcwfiwGIcbk/edit?usp=sharing)-driven points data.
* Useful additions including slab renewal, slab upgrade, cards and other widgets.

### Limitations

As this is the first step in the Member Care refresh journey, we would keep adding components in phases. Hence, you might not see all features of the previous version.

* Actions - Identifier change, goodwill points/coupons issual, mobile reallocation, account merge, tag transactions, fraud status change, customer status change, subscription status change, test and control status change, card linking/delinking, target value change and card status change.
* From the More Information section in the current UI, the following will not be present in the first release of the new CSV UI - Leads, Audit Trails, B2B Loyalty, Points > Slab Change Log, Points > Expiry Schedule, Points -> Historical Points Log 
* User Groups v1 and v2 information and events.
* Request management, Tickets management, coupons search and other items in Member Care that are not related to the CSV.
