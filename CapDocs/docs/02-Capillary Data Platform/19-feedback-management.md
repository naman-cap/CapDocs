## Introduction

Capillary's Feedback Management(CFM) system helps their clients in managing customer feedback. CFM is a process that is based on the systematic collection of customer feedback data, the analysis of the data, and defined dissemination and follow-up actions. With the CFM in place, it becomes easier for the business owners with insight that further can be used to improve their business, products, and/or overall customer experience.
