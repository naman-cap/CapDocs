## Introduction

Extended fields are configurable, system-recognized fields designed to capture structured information specific to certain business verticals, such as food and beverage, hospitality, aviation, and retail. Unlike free-form custom fields, extended fields enforce data consistency through controlled inputs, making them ideal for operational and analytical use.

Each extended field is predefined with attributes such as:

* Field ID
* Name
* Entity type (Example: customer, transaction, transaction line item)
* Label name
* Data type (Example: integer, double, enum, string)

### Key characteristics

* **Standardization**: Extended fields help standardize data capture across brands or organizations, reducing inconsistency often seen with custom fields.
* **Controlled input**: Developers define field names, data types, enum values, and applicable scopes. Validation rules help maintain clean, usable data.
* **Rule-based value capture**: Values for extended fields can be captured and validated based on predefined rules. These rules include:
  * **Logical expressions**: Simple boolean conditions that dictate value acceptance.
  * **Regular expressions (regex)**: Sophisticated patterns that validate data format and content (For example, ensuring an IMEI or a Global Unique Identifier (GUID) adheres to a specific structure). This ensures data conforms to exact specifications from the point of entry.
* **Vertical-specific data capture**: Extended fields are created for specific business verticals like food and beverage, hospitality, aviation, or jewelry. This allows businesses to capture unique attributes relevant to their industry.
* **Reporting-friendly**: Since the values are consistent and structured, extended fields are readily available for reporting, filtering, and analytics.

### Entity types

Entity types define the specific categories of objects or records to which an extended field can be attached. The supported entity types are:

* customer
* regular\_transaction
* return\_transaction
* not\_interested\_transaction
* not\_interested\_return\_transaction
* regular\_lineitem
* return\_lineitem
* not\_interested\_lineitem
* not\_interested\_return\_lineitem

### Properties of extended fields

* Combination of name and entity type for extended fields must be unique.
* Extended fields are not case-sensitive.

### Mapping of extended fields

Extended fields are mapped to vertical IDs that represent business domains. These vertical IDs are further linked to organization IDs, enabling standardized field usage across organizations within the same vertical.

The following diagram illustrates the mapping.

### Verticals and vertical IDs

A vertical is a group that defines the nature of the business. An organization can have multiple verticals mapped to it.

For example, if an organization ABC sells fitness items and apparel, and another organization XYZ sells stationery and sports items, both organizations have one common verticalâ€”sports.

Verticals have the following properties:

* Each vertical is mapped to the relevant set of extended fields.
* The vertical name should be unique across the table.

### Mapping extended fields and vertical IDs

The following properties apply to mapping extended fields and vertical IDs:

* Each extended field can be mapped to only one vertical ID.
* One vertical ID can be mapped to multiple extended fields.
* An extended field with vertical ID `-1` is available for all organizations. These are global fields and can be used by any organization.

### Mapping vertical IDs and organizations

Here are the properties of vertical ID and organization ID mapping:

* Organizations and Verticals have a many-to-many mapping.
* An organization cannot use an extended field that is not within the Verticals associated with it.
* Any organization can use extended fields with the Vertical ID `-1`.

### Validation rules

A validation rule can contain a logical or regex expression that evaluates the extended field values. Validation rules verify whether a field value meets the defined standards before saving it to MongoDB.

That is, if a rule is applied on an extended field, a validation check is performed whenever the field value is received. Once the field value is validated successfully, it will be saved to MongoDB.

Examples of logical rules: >, \<, >=, \<=, =

You first create rules (>, \<) and then map each rule to the extended fields. Following are the properties of validation rules:

* Multiple rules can be applied to an extended field
* One rule can be applied to different fields

### Other validations

In addition to rule validation, we also perform scope validation that is defined in the database tables.

* Only organizations mapped to them can use extended fields with custom enumeration values.
* An organization can use only extended fields that are mapped to it through vertical identifiers.
* Any organization can use extended fields with vertical identifier mapping of `-1`.

## Creating extended fields

To create an extended field, contact the Capillary support team. Extended fields are available in your organization by default. You can hide unused extended fields in the user interface (UI).

## Viewing extended fields

To view the default extended fields for your organization, do the following:

1. In InTouch, navigate to **Settings** > **Master Data Management** > **Data Model** > **Extended Fields**.

![90345f2 image](https://files.readme.io/90345f2-image.png)

2. To view all extended fields, click **All Extended Fields**. Expand the verticals to see the extended fields available for your organization.

## Updating extended fields

You can update an extended field to show or hide it, set the position in the UI, choose whether it is mandatory or optional, and add or remove enumeration values, mark as PII or PSI.

To update,

1. Click the extended field to edit in the **Enabled Extended Fields** tab.

## Supported date formats in extended fields

Extended fields support the following date formats:

* yyyy-MM-dd
* yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ (ISO 8601 with Z for UTC timezone)
* yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss+hh:mm (ISO 8601 with offset)

The table below explains the behaviour using an example specific to the India cluster.

## Creating reports using extended fields

To display the extended fields on Insights and use this data to create reports, perform the following:

* Create a JIRA ticket to the Sustenance team and create a vertical-level field on the Capillary platform.
* Create a JIRA ticket to the Insights team and create an audience filter for the extended field.

## Configuring org extended fields through API

You can configure extended fields for your organization through the Configure organization extended fields API. See the [API documentation](https://docs.capillarytech.com/reference/configure-org-extended-field).
