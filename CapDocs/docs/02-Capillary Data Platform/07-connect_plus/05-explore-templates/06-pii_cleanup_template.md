This template enables you to delete Personal Identifiable Information (PII) data of customers  in bulk.

Perform the following steps:

1. In the **Connect to Source** <Glossary>Block</Glossary>, enter the source server details. See [Connect to source](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/configure-actions#connect-to-source).
2. In the **Decrypt data** block, if the files are encrypted, enter the details to decrypt the data. See [Decrypt data](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/configure-actions#decrypt-data).
3. In the **Data-Validation-Block**, validate or transform data using a Databricks notebook. For more details, refer to [Data-Validation-Block](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/data-validation-block). The block is optional, meaning you can skip it without affecting the dataflow. If you choose to enable it, the rest of the dataflow continues as usual after the execution of the block.
4. In the **Transform data** block, enter the [transformation details](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/configure-actions#transform-data) and map the API fields.
