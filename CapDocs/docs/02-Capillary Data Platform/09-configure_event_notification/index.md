Event Notifications is a framework that provides near real-time data of events generated in the Capillary System and helps brands subscribe to notifications about particular events.

## Overview

Event Notification allows building integrations with Capillary events that originate either through Capillary API (such as customerAdded and transactionAdded)requests or Capillary products such as Loyalty+ (such as pointsIssued and pointsRedeemed), Engage+ or other. Once an event notification is configured, brands can build custom solutions to trigger for pre-configured actions.\
Event Notifications are sent through Webhooks configured in Capillary Event Notifications. The following is the top-level diagram, of the Events Notification framework (ENS).

## Use Cases

There are several use cases of event notifications. A couple of examples are provided in the following.

* **Enable PII-less Communication**

In some cases, brands prefer not to send customers' personally identifiable information (PII data) such as names, email ID, and mobile number to Capillary and manage communication completely at their end. Event Notification can be used to get the events that require communication such as customer registration, transaction, points issual, points redemption, points transfer, etc. On receiving these events, clients can send communication to customers with their names and identifiers as needed.

* **Integration with 3rd Party Applications**

Event notification can be used to build integrations with 3rd party applications. For example, send a survey link to a customer post transaction event from a survey application such as Medallia; sync customer’s loyalty information to an e-commerce platform such as Magento. Integration can be built to receive real-time events, enrich information using Capillary APIs (if required), and sync it to the 3rd party application using the brand's APIs.

## Steps involved in ENS set up

The following are the steps involved in the set up of the Event Notification Service (ENS) for a client.

* Webhook creation

Webhooks let you create an integration URL that is required to post events data from ENS to Webhook. Before starting with the configuration process, you need to create a Webhook account and generate a URL. The URL is further used to post events generated by the client (This can be done by creating an API proxy for API Gateway such as Apigee). 

* Event Notification Configuration

Once you have the Webhook URL, you need to subscribe to the events that need to be notified. This can be done either through UI or API. For more details, see [Add Event Notification](https://capillary-documentation.readme.io/docs/add-event-notification-account)

* Event Consumption

Once the setup is completed, the client can consume and process events data and use the data to configure actions to trigger. For more details see, [Consuming event notification](https://capillary-documentation.readme.io/docs/consuming-event-notifications)
