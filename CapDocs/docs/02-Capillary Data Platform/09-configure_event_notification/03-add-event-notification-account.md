   > ðŸ“˜ Note
   >
   > By default, the customer identifiers are not available in the event notification payload. The presence of identifiers in the payload depends on:
   >
   > * How the API was called - the identifier used to make the API call will be included in the payload
   > * Whether identifier enrichment is explicitly enabled

* Select **Store** to capture store details - store data enrichment. The payload will contain store details such as store name, store ID, store code, and store external ID.
* By default, the **customer identifiers** are not available in the event notification payload. The presence of identifiers in the payload depends on:
  * How the API was called - the identifier used to make the API call will be included in the payload
  * Whether identifier enrichment is explicitly enabled.\
    To include a customer identifier in the payload, select Customer identifier to capture customer identifiers according to the selected source - customer data enrichment. You will see the Source drop-down as shown in the following screenshots. Select the source identifier that you want to capture. The available options are WeChat, WebEngage, and InStore. For example, if you select Instore and the Instore profile of the customer contains an external ID, mobile and email, the event response payload will include the identifiers external ID, mobile and email.
* Including card information along with the customer identifier information - You can select the **Card Number** to include card details of the customer in the event payload. An associated source (channel or source from which the card number is obtained or linked to a customer's profile) must be selected before selecting the Card Number check box. If the customer has multiple card numbers, all the card numbers are added.

* The **Awarded Reference ID** is a unique identifier associated with each issued point or redemption transaction within the system. These IDs are generated upon awarding loyalty points and can be used to track points issuance and redemption activities. In this context, you can select the Awarded Reference ID checkbox to capture the reference ID of the points issued as a result of the behavioural events.
* Available Points Balance: To capture the total available points across multiple program IDs the customer is associated with, you can raise a JIRA ticket to the sustenance team and enable the configuration `availablePointsBalanceEnrichmentEnabled`. Once activated, the system automatically records the customer's total points balance across`pointsIssued`and `pointsRedeemed `events in the `AvailablePointsBalance` field.
* Select **Enrich through Neo dataflow** to enrich or transform data through Neo dataflows. Choose the required Neo dataflow from the drop-down. For details, refer to [Event Notification Enrichment](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/event-notification-enrichment). This option is not available by default. Create a Jira support request with the Product Support Team to make this option available.
