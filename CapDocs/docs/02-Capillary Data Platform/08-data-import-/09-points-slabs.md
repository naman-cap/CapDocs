> * You can add points only for existing transaction line items.

>   * The points allocation date is the date on which the points are actually added to the current points. For example:\
>         *If a transaction with bill date A is sent to Loyalty EMF on date B, the awarded date will be date B.\&#xA;* If a transaction/add on date A gets replayed on date B, the awarded date will be date B.\
>           \* If bill points with bill date A are imported on date B, the awarded date will be date B.
>   * The 'delayed accrual points' will be added to the 'current points' on the next morning of the (event date  + number of days of delay) specified in the point allocation strategy
>   * if a transaction is added on 28th Sep and the number of days of delay is 1, the delayed accrual points will get added to current points on the morning of 30th Sep (morning after 28th Sep + 1 day). The awarded date will be 30th Sep.
>   * An event should have same type of points allocation strategies (either direct allocation or delayed accrual but not both).
>   * An event cannot have allocation strategies with different delay accrual period.

* Till IUN Or Store Ext Id(Store Code)
* Item id/ Item Code\*
* Transaction Number(Bill Number)\* (If Identification of Bill is chosen as STANDARD\_FIELD)
* Date Of Transactions(Bill Date)\* (If Identification of Bill is chosen as STANDARD\_FIELD)
* Points\*
* Mobile/ Email/External id/ User id(Original User Identifier): Identifier of the actual customer who made the transaction. Required for group transaction.

**Note**: You can get the loyalty\_log\_id in the user\_management.loyalty\_log table

**Template Configuration**\
If you import multiple files using a specific template, all will have the same promotion identifier assigned to them.

* The identifier is retained as long as no changes are made to the template.
* When you make a change in the template and save, a new identifier is generated.

# Slab (tier)

You can use this profile to update the loyalty tiers of customers or groups. You can also use this profile to update only the expiry date of the tiers.

To import the loyalty slabs of registered customers or groups, perform the following:

1. Create a CSV file with the following fields:

   1. Customer identifier (email/mobile number/external ID/user ID). The mobile number is mandatory.
   2. Group identifier (group external ID, primary user ID, group ID, email/mobile number/external ID of the primary user)
   3. Store's External ID/ Store Terminal User Name
   4. Slab Name - This is a mandatory field.
   5. Notes
   6. Last Slab Change Date
   7. Custom Slab Expiry Date - You can use this option to change the expiry dates of customer tiers in bulk. For example, during the onboarding of new brands or can also be used to update customers' tier expiry date in bulk whenever required.\
       This field becomes mandatory if the configuration `Set custom slab expiry date for the users` is selected.\
      **Notes:**
      * The expiry date should be a future date and not beyond the year 2100.
      * The date should be in the `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` format. If the expiry date is added in the `YYYY-MM-DD` format, the system will consider it as `YYYY-MM-DD 00:00:00`.

   **Sample CSV file format:**\
   `user_id,store_code,slab_name,notes,last_slab_change_date,new_slab_expiry_date
