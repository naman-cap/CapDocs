## Update Points Expiry (Date range)

This profile lets you update the validity of points (of a customer) that are expiring in a specific date range. It is very important to understand how the issued and expired points will be affected by this import.\
Example:

Consider Blue Purple(org) loyalty program is having 12 months of points validity for a list of customers which they want to change to 24 months. In such case, you can select the extended expiry type and use the relative point expiry option to update the point expiry duration from 12 to 24 months.

| Facts                      | Date & duration                              |

| Current date               | August 01, 2021                              |
| Actual point expiry date   | July 31, 2022 (12 months from current date)  |
| Extended point expiry date | July 31, 2023  (24 months from current date) |

## Update Points Expiry (PointsType & RefID)

This profile lets you modify the points expiry of a customer based on Point Awarded Reference Type and Point Awarded Reference ID. It is very important to understand how the issued and expired points will be affected by this import.

**Example**:

Consider there are five customers in an org with different reasons to update their point expiry and you want to update customer 1, customer 2, and rest customers(customer 3, 4, and 5) with different expiry type(extended or early expiry) and date(fixed, relative, or immediate).

* **Use case 1 -  Update expiry for a customers with point awarded reference ID**\
  Consider customer 1 has accidentally received points with a incorrect validly (incorrect validity awarded - 4 months, correct validity should be - 6 months). In this case, you can update customer 1 with an extended points expiry of 2 months(relative) using point awarded reference ID.\
  Note: When point awarded reference ID is mentioned then you also have to mention point awarded reference type in the csv file.\

| Incorrect point expiry date | September 31, 2021 (31 days from current date)                     |
| Extended point expiry date  | October 31, 2021 (After 2 months from incorrect point expiry date) |

* **Use case 2 -  Update expiry for a customers with point awarded reference type**\
  Consider customer 1 has 100 points that are going to expire on August 31, 2021 but the store will be closed from August 22, 2021 to August 31, 2021(10 days) due to store redesigning. In this case, you can update customer 2 with an extended points expiry of 10 days(relative) using point awarded reference type.

| Extended point expiry date | September 09, 2021 (Points expiring after 10 days from actual point expiry date) |

* **Use case 3 -  Update expiry for a list of customers**\
  Consider customer 3, 4, and 5 have 100 points each that are going to expire on September 30, 2021 but the store will be closed permanently after August 31, 2021 due to business failure. In this case, you can update customer 3, 4, and 5 with an early points expiry date - August 31, 2021(fixed).

## Update Points Expiry (using Promotion ID)

This profile lets you update the points expiry of a customer based on Loyalty Promotion ID. 

It is very important to understand how the issued and expired points will be affected by this import.

**Example**:

Consider that 100 promotional points wrongly awarded to 10 customers of an org. Now the org want to remove the promotional points from all 10 customers. In such case, you can select the promotion and use the customer identifier(User ID/External ID/Email/Mobile/Card Number) to change the expiry type(early expiry) and date(immediately). 

| Facts                   | Date & duration                               |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| Early point expiry date | Immediate expiry (on the date of data import) |
