* Till IUN Or Store Ext Id(Store Code)
* Points To Be Reduced(Points)
* Transaction Number(Bill Number)
* Transaction Date(Bill Date)

* The identifier is retained as long as no changes are made to the template.
* When you make a change in the template and save, a new identifier is generated.

  * It is very important to understand how the issued and expired points will be affected by this import.
    For example, if you want to deduct 300 points from a transaction for which 500 points are issued, you will pass points to be deducted as 300. What will happen to the points issued for that customer?

    * As per the transaction, we cannot expire partial points, the entire points of the transaction (500) will be expired first and 200 points (500-300) will be issued again. In this, the total issued points will be 700 (500+200). However, points for individual line items will be deducted according to the expiry dates.
</Callout>

## Manual Points Adjustment

This profile lets you deduct points from customers accounts manually. There can be erroneous scenarios where brands want to deduct some points from customers.

For example : A transaction was done and the brand imported the points with the bill_id. Now when a customer returns the bill via a credit card of let's say HDFC, HDFC doesnâ€™t know what was the original bill. And hence there is no way to link the original and the return bill. In such cases, HDFC would want to create a new PA entry with all points as returned. This will be similar to negative PA entry but only the return value will be -ve. Thus overall the points will be reduced for the customer.

Today in our system, points can be deducted in three ways : Redeemed, expired and returned.
**In this case, the points will be considered as returned.**

* User identifiers like mobile , userId, externalId etc,
* Reason for manual adjustment
* Points to deduct

Optional fields can be program_id, promotion_id, promotion_external_identifier and points awarded_id
