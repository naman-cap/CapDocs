Retro transaction refers to the facility of tagging not-interested transactions to loyalty program customers. That is, a not-interested transaction can be tagged to the respective customer when the customer registers into the loyalty program within the window period (allowed to convert not-interested transactions). 

# Configuring the window period for retro transaction

You can customize the retro transaction window period by adjusting the `CONF_CLIENT_RETRO_MAX_ALLOWED_AGE_DAYS` setting in **Organisation > Billing** configuration page.

Additionally, you have the option to incorporate a buffer time using the `CONF_CLIENT_RETRO_DELAY_SINCE_REGISTRATION_HOURS` configuration. For instance, if you set this value to 3 hours and a customer registers at 9:00 AM, they will be able to claim loyalty points for non-interested transactions with billing times later than 6:00 AM but not before 5:59 AM.

## Handling retro transactions as per original transaction date.

Retroactive transactions, also known as retro transactions, refer to transactions that are applied to a loyalty program account after the transaction has taken place. This can occur for a variety of reasons, such as an error in the transaction process, a delay in the transaction being recorded, or a promotion being applied retroactively to a past purchase.

### Retro case in airlines

Retroactive flight rewards refer to the ability to redeem miles or points for flights that you have already taken. Many airline loyalty programs allow you to retroactively claim rewards for flights that you have taken in the past, as long as you were a member of the loyalty program at the time of travel and you have the necessary documentation (e.g., a copy of your boarding pass or ticket receipt).

To claim retroactive rewards, you will typically need to contact the airline's customer service department and provide them with your loyalty program account information and the details of your past flights. The process for claiming retroactive rewards can vary by airline.

It's worth noting that retroactive flight rewards may not be available for all flights or may be subject to certain restrictions, such as blackout dates or limited availability. It's always a good idea to check with the airline to see what your options are for claiming retroactive rewards.

**Let's understand with one example:**

Take for example, a customer made a flight journey on 20th March but not given loyalty details on that date. Instead, at some point in the future (say 20th april), wishes to avail the benefits of that journey, and so reaches out to customer service for the same. In this case, the processing date (20th April) is more than the transaction date (20th March). 

This might lead to a problem, because the customer might have upgraded/degraded from a tier in this time period. Say, the customer might be on the silver tier on 20th March and Gold tier on 20th April. If the journey is processed as per 20th April, benefits will be given as per the gold slab even though the customer is on the silver slab on the date of the transaction.

**Let's understand with one more example:**

A brand has the below strategy for tier upgrade. Take 5 international flights in a year and upgrade from silver to gold. Else the customer will be downgraded. 

Tier upgrade to silver - Jan 1, 23\
Tier downgrade/renewal date - Jan 1, 24

Now, let's take the above same scenario, however this time the claim happens in next year.
