## Reallocate Mobile Number (to a New Customer)

Telecom companies usually reallocate old disconnected numbers (after it has remained unused for some time) to new customers. In such scenarios where a new customer has a mobile number of the already registered customer (but inactive), you can reallocate the number to the new customer.

For example, consider this case where Tom registers in your loyalty program with the mobile number: 123456789 and is not active for a very long time. Hence, the number is deactivated by the telecom company. Suppose the same number is allocated to another person named John who wants to register in the loyalty program. As Tom is no longer active on the registered mobile number, you can reallocate the number to John and register him.

To reallocate the mobile number, do the following.

1. On the navigation pane, click ID Change Requests > Mobile Reallocation.

The Mobile Number Re-Allocation Requests page displays the requests for reallocating the old mobile numbers to new customers.
