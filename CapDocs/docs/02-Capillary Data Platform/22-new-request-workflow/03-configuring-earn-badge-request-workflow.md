This request is mapped to a standard workflow and allows you to submit requests to issue badges for customers.

### Earn badges standard workflow

As part of the standard workflow, the Capillary platform provides a two-step approval process involving a Maker and Checker-based workflow. 

1. Users with “CanMakeRequest” access can submit a request to issue a badge to a customer.
2. Users with “CanCheckRequest” access can approve or reject the request. 

Once a Checker approves a request, the system executes it, issuing a badge to a customer.

### Configurations

You can enable **Auto-approval** configuration to enable auto-approval of certain user requests.

To configure, from the Request Workflows list, navigate to **Earn\_badge** > **Edit request workflow mapping**, turn on the **Auto-approval flag** toggle and click **Save**
