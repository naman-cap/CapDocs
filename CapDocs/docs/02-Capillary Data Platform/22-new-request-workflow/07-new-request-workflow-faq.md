1. **What is the difference between a standard workflow and a custom workflow in the context of Capillary's platform?**

* Standard Workflow: A standard workflow is a predefined series of tasks that all brands have by default. The Capillary product/tech team developed it to fulfil the common criteria of most brands.
* Custom Workflow: A customized workflow is a set of tasks created exclusively for a brand. When the standard workflow fails to fulfil a brand's specific requirements, the Capillary Solutions team creates a custom workflow to address those needs

2. **How do I decide whether to use a standard workflow or opt for a custom workflow?**\
   Select a standard process if your brand's needs are similar to those met by the platform's established workflows. These ready-to-use workflows are intended to serve the majority of companies and can efficiently manage typical processes without the need for further customization.\
   Opt a Custom Workflow if your brand has unique requirements not covered by typical processes, consider creating a custom workflow. Custom workflows are best suited for complex use cases that require numerous approval phases, validation-based processes, or extension-based validation. In such circumstances, you can contact the Capillary Solutions team to create a custom procedure that meets your specific requirements.
3. **Can you provide examples of scenarios where a custom workflow would be more beneficial than a standard one? Implementation and Integration.**\
   Scenario: Your brand has distinct operational requirements or business regulations not met by standard workflows. For example, in multiple-approval workflows, auto-approval is set for a certain points range; another range requires approval by a senior resource, and for a certain range, a senior manager’s approval is required.\
   Implementation & Integration: By collaborating with the Capillary Solutions team, you can create custom workflows         tailored to your brand's unique requirements, ensuring that all processes are optimized and aligned with your business goals.
4. **What parameters can be customized within a standard workflow to fit our brand’s specific needs?**\
   Request auto-approval: If your brand wants specific requests to be authorized automatically, this option can be modified accordingly.\
   Goodwill point limit: You can choose a maximum number of Goodwill points that can be requested.
5. **Can we prepare a report of the submitted requests on Insights?**\
   Reporting on the new requests is still not available on Insights and will be available in the future releases.
6. **How can I access audit logs for requests processed through the new workflow framework?**\
   The audit logging of the requests can be performed using the request workflow APIs. A request ID is created for every request, allowing you to retrieve the associated details using this ID.
7. **How will existing organizations using older workflows for Goodwill points and retro-transaction claims transition to the new request framework?**\
   Transitioning existing organizations using older workflows for goodwill points and retro-transaction claims to the new request framework is planned for future releases. This migration will ensure that all organizations benefit from the enhanced features and capabilities of the new workflow system.
