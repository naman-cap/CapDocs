The users in an organisation are classified into three types:

* **Organisation owner** - Has full control over the organisation, including user and permission management.
* **Admin User** - Created by the organisation owner to manage standard users and assign permissions.
* **Standard user** - Has restricted access and cannot manage users or permissions.

## Organisation Owner

An organisation owner (org owner) will have full authority over an organisation and all the modules and can add other standard or org owner-type users. An organisation must have at least one org owner. 

The org owners can perform the following:

* Create more Org owners if required. 
* Create, View, Update, and Delete any standard or admin users.
* Create, View, Update, and Delete [Permission sets](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/managing-permissions#custom-permission-sets). 
* Assign permissions to other users. 

## Admin User

Admin Users are explicitly created by Organisation Owners to handle specific tasks and perform duties on their behalf. Their access to the organisation and its subsets, including specific stores, concepts (org units), and zones, is determined by the Organisation Owner. Admin Users can:

* Create, view, and delete Standard Users.
* Provide access permissions to Standard Users.

## Standard User

A Standard User is an individual with restricted access within the organisation. A Standard User is created by an Admin User, who sets their access to the organisation and its subsets, including specific stores, concepts (org units), and zones. Standard Users can only view their own profile and do not have access to manage other users or their permissions. Access must be explicitly assigned by an Org Owner or Admin User.
