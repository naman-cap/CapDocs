Users can be onboarded to the system through two methods:

* **Individual Email Addresses**:Add users one-by-one by entering their email addresses. This approach is suitable for onboarding a small number of users.
* **Bulk User Import**: Add multiple users at once by uploading a CSV file containing user details.This method is efficient for onboarding a large number of users.

A user can also be part of [multiple organizations](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/managing-permission-for-users-in-multiple-orgs). Adding users to each organization follows the same process as adding single or bulk users to an individual organization.

# Adding Users

## Prerequisites

* **CAP POC:** Ensure a CAP POC is set for the organization. To set, navigate to **Organization setings** > **Organization Setup** > **Organization Profile** > **Organization POC**. This is required to send an email to set a password for the user.

* **Roles Definition:** Define the role of the organization. The roles below should be present in small cases.\
  **Note:** The case sensitivity in the org roles will be removed in future releases.
  * Org Level - Access to the entire organization-level data.
  * Store Level - Access only to store-level data
  * Zone Level - Access only to a zone level data
  * Concept Level - Access only to concept-level data

## Using Individual Email Addresses

This feature enables you to add users by entering their email IDs. All email addresses will receive the same level of permissions chosen in this process. A maximum of 10 emails can be added at once. For adding more users, the bulk user upload feature is available to create users in bulk efficiently.

Perform the following:

> ðŸš§ Note

> * Admin access required
> * You need to have org access to add the users.

1. Click **Add new user**.

![c4706865 d9e2 421f 9f8e 8e19f399ef5c](https://usercontent.clueso.io/64d06f10-2e0e-40ec-b636-a868315fe5a6/89ec4425-e73d-4fbf-aec4-fa2ee10793f4/acb0a7f8-ef60-4e6c-9a5b-7bb84b846ea6/images/c4706865-d9e2-421f-9f8e-8e19f399ef5c.png)

5. For **Standard users** - Select the entities to which you want to give access for those user(s) and click **Continue**. You can give access to the entire Organisation or certain Org units or Stores.\
   **Note**: Organisation owners will have access to the entire org by default, and hence there is no need to select any entity for an Org owner.

   Org owners will have full authority, so there is no need to select any permission set for an org owner.

Once the Send Invite button is clicked, an email is triggered to the user's email address to set the user password. If the automatic email delivery fails or the user has not received the email, you can [copy the invite link and send it manually](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/onboarding-user#sending-user-registration-email-manually). For information on password requirements, refer to [documentation on the password requirements](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/onboarding-user#password-requirements).

## Adding Bulk Users

You can use the bulk-upload option to add users in bulk. With the bulk upload, you can have different permissions mapped to different users. A maximum of 200 users can be added using bulk upload.

To add the users in bulk, perform the following:

1. Click **Add new user**.

![7c83c4ae 9f98 4164 b4bb 5920f2e24b55](https://usercontent.clueso.io/64d06f10-2e0e-40ec-b636-a868315fe5a6/89ec4425-e73d-4fbf-aec4-fa2ee10793f4/acb0a7f8-ef60-4e6c-9a5b-7bb84b846ea6/images/7c83c4ae-9f98-4164-b4bb-5920f2e24b55.png)

2. Select the bulk upload option.

![275a1ba Bulk upload user](https://files.readme.io/275a1ba-Bulk_upload_user.png)

3. Upload the CSV file. You can download the sample file, enter the values, and you can upload the same file. You can have multiple people on this list, and can also have different permissions for each person. So that way, you can customize permission for different users through this bulk upload flow.
