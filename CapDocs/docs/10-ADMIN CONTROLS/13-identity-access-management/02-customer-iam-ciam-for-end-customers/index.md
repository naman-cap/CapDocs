Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) for end customers is an access management solution designed for customer-facing applications. CIAM is essential for brands to provide secure and seamless authentication for their customers. 

Authentication methods can include a simple login with a username and password, social sign-in that allows customers to log in using their social media credentials, OTP-based authentication, single sign-on and more. 

Capillary offers multiple options to meet a brand's authentication needs for customer-facing applications:
