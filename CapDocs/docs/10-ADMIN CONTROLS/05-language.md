Orgs with an online presence (web/mobile app) in languages, other than English, need multi-lingual support to show cart promotion and store details in their preferred languages. It supports translations for both standard fields and custom fields.

The promotions and store details are created from the Capillary side. Hence, to show these details in a different language, you will first need to add the translation in your preferred language and then use the APIs to display it on the web or mobile app accordingly.

**Limitations**\
By default, not all fields of cart promotions or stores are enabled for translation. It will require effort from development and will go through the customer request or enhancement process.

**Prerequisites**

* Before configuring information in different languages, you will need to get the required languages enabled for the org.
* You will need to get the required fields (of cart promotion or stores) enabled for the org.\
  Create a JIRA ticket and assign it to the support or project management team with the complete details of the requirement. It might take 24 to 48 working hours to enable multi-language/fields for translation for an org.
