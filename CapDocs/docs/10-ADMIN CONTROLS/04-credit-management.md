### Manage Org SMS/Email Credits Introduction

Orgs are charged for communications (SMS, email, and X-Engage) sent to customers through Capillary products such as Loyalty+ or Engage+.  Capillary lets the org admins, finance teams, and Capillary Business teams manage org credits through Credits Management console. A user can add credits, remove credits, and monitor credit balance.

The following are the important points you need to know about credits.

* 1 Credit = 1 unit of currency of the org - It could be INR, USD, SGD, AED, and so on.

* Estimated Credits in Message Summary is calculated using the default values set for the org and the entire audience list.

* The actual credits redemption and ledger update happen when the message is executed (based on customer availability and customerâ€™s country code in case of SMS).

* Transaction SMS and Emails (Loyalty and OTP) also consume credits based on the rate card but it will not block sending messages even if there is an insufficient credit balance.  In that case, the credit balance will become negative.

> * Only org admins, and selected finance and Capillary Business teams can access the Credits Management module.
> * Before proceeding, ensure that Credit Management is enabled for the org.
