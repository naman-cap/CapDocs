Capillary ensures API security through strong authentication and authorization methods. 

**Authentication** verifies that only users with appropriate credentials can access Capillary APIs whereas **Authorization** ensures that authenticated users with the right permissions can use specific APIs or resources. In simpler terms, a user with valid credentials can access APIs according to their allowed permissions, which are managed by authorization.
