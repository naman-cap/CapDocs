The export feature allows you to export metric values for a specific customer list, using an audience filter in a template. For example, you can export transactions made by a specific audience in a particular store. 

Make sure to use the appropriate template based on the data you want to export.

See the following example for a better understanding:

> ðŸ“˜ Example
>
> Scenario: Alan needs to export loyalty details of customers who registered at a specific store.
>
> Details: You can retrieve registered customers of a specific store using the Members template. However, the maximum time frame for data export is one year, so exporting the entire set of registered customers in one job is not possible.
>
> Solution:
>
> 1. Create an audience group using filters to identify customers registered in the specific store. For details, see the **Registered Store** filter under the loyalty category.
> 2. In **Export** framework, select the **Members** template and apply the required audience filter.
> 3. Schedule the export. The exported list will contain all customers who registered at the specific store, regardless of the date range selected.

Important points to note when creating an audience list:

* The **Members** template only allows you to retrieve loyalty and non-loyalty customers.
* The **Users** template lets you export all target audiences of a campaign, regardless of their loyalty status.
* Date range is not applicable in audience list exports, and the **Based on** field is set to **Audience selected** by default.

<Note title="Note">
* To export the audience of a specific campaign using templates other than Users and Members, ensure you select the campaign name, campaign ID, or group name as a filter. Else, the audience list will include audience from all campaigns.
* Custom fields are not selected by default in any template.
* Customers with a birth year before 1901 cannot be retrieved.
* Standard filters, such as outlier status, fraud status, merge status, and admin till, cannot be applied.
</Note>

Configuring a customer list export schedule involves the following steps:

1. Define a name and description for the export job.
2. Set up the frequency and validity of the job.
3. Choose the templates with events data.
4. Tag the audience list to the template.

To export an audience list, perform the following:

1. On Insights+, navigate to **Data connectors** > **Export Schedules**
2. Click **Create New**.

3. Schedule Name: Specify a unique name for the current schedule job (maximum character length is 60). Do not include special characters. Use of underscores (\_) or spaces in the name are allowed. Example: Summer Sale Transactions or Summer\_Sale\_Transactions. 
4. Description: Provide a brief description of the schedule (maximum character length is 250).
5. FTP location:

* For external use: From the FTP drop-down list, select the FTP server to which you want to export the data. The file gets saved to the default location on the chosen FTP server. For more information on configuring the FTP server, see Configuring FTP Server for Data Export. (HYPERLINK)
* For internal use: You can either select FTP (to save the files in the preferred FTP location) or S3 (to save the files in the internal S3 server). No server configuration is required to export to S3 (CHECK???)

6. Frequency: Select how often to run the export job: once, daily, weekly, or monthly. The maximum duration for a scheduled job is one year.

<Note title="Note">
* For recurring schedules, in the **Validity** field, you cannot select past dates. You may only select the current date or a future date.
* For one-time schedules, you can select a past date range, limited to the duration for which data is available.
* You can schedule an export based on either the **Last Updated Date** or **Event Date**.
