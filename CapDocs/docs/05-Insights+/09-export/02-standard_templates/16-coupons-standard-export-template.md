The coupons template is based on the **[Coupons](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/coupons-fact-table)** fact. 

The template lets you export details of:

* Coupons issued at customer level and transaction level;
* Transaction numbers along with coupon details, redeemed and expired coupons, and coupon level custom fields.

<Note title="Note">
* While using the coupons template, you need to select custom fields manually.
* Coupons that are issued or redeemed will be tagged to a transaction, only if both the transaction and coupon issual or redemption occurs within the span of  +/- 15 minutes.
