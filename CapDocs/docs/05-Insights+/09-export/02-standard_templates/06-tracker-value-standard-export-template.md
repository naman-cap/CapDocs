The Tracker Value template is based on the **Points** fact.

It lets you export tracker values generated through the Loyalty Engine to update slabs. 

* Provides tracker values at the bill or line-item level.
* Includes all tracker bills within the specified duration, regardless of slab status.
* Exports are by entry, not cumulative.

**Limitations**

* You cannot export the current tracker value.

To know more about trackers and configurations, see [Trackers](doc:offer-conditions)
