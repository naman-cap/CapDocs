There are 3 export templates for points data.

# Points


The Points template is based on the **[Points](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/points-fact-table)** fact.

* With this template you can export the data of points related events such as points issual, and points deduction (redeemed, expired, and returned).
* You will get only the detailed break up of deducted points but not the summarized one.
* The template will have the filters “redeemable” and “not applicable (deducted)”, applied by default.

<Note title="Note">
**Note**

Note

Points that are redeemed will be tagged to a transaction, only if both the transaction and points redemption occurs within the span of +- 15 minutes.
</Note>

# Points Expiry Reminder Info


The Points Expiry Reminder template is based on the [**Points Expiry Reminder Info**](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/points-fact-table) fact. The fact lets you export the details of points expiry reminders sent to customers through Loyalty Engine. These are automated reminders configured for points expiry.
