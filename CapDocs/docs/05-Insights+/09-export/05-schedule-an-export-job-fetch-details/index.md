An export job can be either: 

* Recurring: This job runs on a regular schedule (e.g., daily). It only exports new or updated data since the last export. For example, if the job is set to run daily for a month, each day it exports only the data from the previous day.
* One-Time: This job runs only once and exports the data available at that specific time.

# Prerequisites

* Insights access
* [FTP server configuration](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/configure-ftp-server-for-data-export)
* Make sure the FTP server is correctly set up to handle data exports. This setup is crucial for the successful transfer of data.

<Note title="Note">
* The system does not assure a fixed finish time for the jobs. The export framework picks up a job according to the order of scheduled time. 
* Please note that you cannot:
  * Edit the template after creation.
  * Modify KPIs, dimensions, filters, and customer list once scheduled.
  * Export measures (such as bill id, bill number, bill amount, auto update time) and custom fields in custom templates. You can export only KPIs and its dimensions.
* Current day's data will not be included in the exported data as the data will be synced to the capillary server only during non-business hours.

# Configuring an export schedule

Perform the following steps to configure an export schedule:

1. [Create an Export Job (Step 1 of 3)](doc:create-an-export-job-step-1-of-3)  .
2. [Select Data Templates (Step 2 of 3)](doc:select-data-templates-step-2-of-3) templates that you want to export.
3. [Modifying Template & Creating Schedule (Step 3 of 3)](doc:modifying-template-creating-schedule-step-3-of-3) templates to add or remove fields, apply filters and dimensions to export a specific data that you need
4. Click **Create** to schedule

> ðŸ“˜ Important
>
> * When you use a Dimension template, the entire data will be exported irrespective of the duration filter applied. Hence, it is recommended not to use templates of Dimensions, Users for example, for recurring schedules unless you wanted to apply the Audience Group filter on it
> * You cannot apply standard filters such as outlier status, fraud status, merge status, and admin TILL

Once scheduled, the recipients will receive emails as per the scheduled frequency with the job details including the destination link of the exported data.

<Note title="Note">
As the export job writes the files in the specified FTP location, It is recommended to periodically check whether the username/password of the FTP location is configured correctly.\
To access files from the FTP location, user should have read access to the FTP location

A job has one of the following statuses: Yet to Execute, Success, or In Progress.

| **Icon**        | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Clock icon**  | Indicates that the job is created but has not yet executed.                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Yellow icon** | Indicates that an execution is currently in progress. A recurring scheduled job can have multiple executions, while a one-time job will have only one.                                                            |
| **Green icon**  | Indicates the job is successfully executed. For recurring jobs, the icon turns green upon successful completion of the current execution. It will change back to yellow when the next scheduled execution begins. |
| **Red icon**    | Indicates the job is unable to execute.                                                                                                                                                                           |
