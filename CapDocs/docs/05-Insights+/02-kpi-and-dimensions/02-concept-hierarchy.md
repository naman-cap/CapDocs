# Introduction

Concept Hierarchy is a way to group stores based on business-specific classifications. Instead of grouping by location (like Country or Zone), concept hierarchies organize stores by characteristics such as:

* Type of products sold (e.g., Electronics, Jewelry, Apparels)
* Store format or location (e.g., Stores in malls vs. Stores outside malls)

This allows brands to analyze and compare performance across different store types or formats more effectively, based on how the business operates.

**For Example**: a brand wants to analyze data at multiple levels of their store network. Let us assume they have the following store hierarchy:\
**Country → Zone → Store → Till**\
By setting this up, they can view reports that start at the country level and allow users to drill down all the way to the till level.

# How to Set It Up

1. Configure Hierarchy in **CDP**. Refer to the[ Setup Customer Hierarchy ](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/hierarchy)guide for detailed instructions.
2. Then go to **Insights** > **Settings** > **Dimensions**
3. Edit Hierarchy, up to **7 levels of hierarchy are supported.**
