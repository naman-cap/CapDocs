# KPI

A Key Performance Indicator (KPI) is a specific metric that reflects how effectively your organization achieves its key business objectives. KPIs are displayed using the data ingested on Insights+.

For example, KPIs such as Points redeemed, Total spent, etc give you information about the points redeemed by the customer and total spend by the customer.

# Dimension

Dimensions are descriptive attributes or categories that provide context to data. They are often used to filter data for better understanding and analysis. To see the full list of dimension tables available in Insights+ and their descriptions, refer to the [Dimension Tables documentation](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/dimension-tables).

For instance, consider an organization with ‚ÄòMonthly Sales Revenue‚Äô as its KPI and  ‚ÄúProduct Categories‚Äù and ‚ÄúGeographical Location‚Äù as its defined dimensions.\
By using these dimensions, the organization can extract meaningful insights. For example, they can understand ‚ÄòMonthly Sales Revenue for Home Appliances‚Äô or ‚ÄòMonthly Sales Revenue in North America‚Äô based on the specific product category and geographical region.

To view the Dimensions, perform the following:

1. On the Insights+ homepage, expand **Library**dropdown.
