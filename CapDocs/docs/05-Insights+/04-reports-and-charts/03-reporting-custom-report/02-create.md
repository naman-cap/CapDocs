# Example Scenario: Analysing Badge Earnings

Consider a scenario where a brand wants to analyse the badge earnings of their customers. To support this analysis, a chart has been created in the "Create Charts" section. Please refer to the [badges earned chart](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/create-chart#use-case). In this section, we will add the chart to our report for further analysis. 

Follow the steps below to create a report using the badges earned chart:

1. Navigate to Insights+ > **Reports**.
2. Click **Create report**.
3. Fill in the **Report Name** and **Description**. Select the appropriate **Category**. Select the report **Type** as **Normal**.
4. Click **Next**.
5. Click **+Add/remove charts**. 
6. Type the chart name or scroll through the chart list to locate the desired chart. In this use case, we will select the **Badges Earned** chart from the chart list. 
7. Click **Done**. The chart gets added to the report. 
8. Set the report Date range by clicking on the calendar icon. In this report we are selecting the report date to contain data for the last 1 year. Click **Apply**. 
9. The chart having the desired KPIs and dimensions in the specified date range, gets populated. Click **Save report**.

# Key Insights from the Badges Earned Report

**Majority Engagement from Lower Tiers**\
Customers in lower sales ranges, especially the Base tier, account for nearly 80% of all badge earnings, indicating strong engagement at the lower end of the loyalty spectrum.

**Peak Engagement Period**\
June 2024 has a high number of badges earned, suggesting successful campaigns or promotions during this time, particularly among Base and Silver customers.

**Low Engagement in Premium Tiers**\
Higher-tier customers, such as those in Gold and Platinum, contribute significantly fewer badges, indicating a need for strategies to increase engagement.

**Opportunities for Re-engagement**\
Badge earnings are minimal in certain tiers, contributing only 1% or less, signalling an opportunity to re-engage these customers with targeted efforts.

These insights suggest focusing on maintaining base tier engagement while improving badge earning in higher tiers.
