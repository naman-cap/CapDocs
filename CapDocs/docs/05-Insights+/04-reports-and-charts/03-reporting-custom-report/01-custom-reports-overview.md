Custom reports can be created by the users, by designing and tailoring them to meet unique requirements and preferences. There are 4 types of custom reports - Normal, Migration, Funnel and External report.

With custom reports, you can choose multiple charts and combine them into a comprehensive report tailored to your specific requirements.

# When do you need Custom Reports?

While Insights+ provides standard reports, there are instances where these may not meet specific reporting needs. In such cases, users have the flexibility to generate custom reports by incorporating various charts to better align with their unique requirements.

# What do Custom Reports offer?

* Size and placement adjustment of chosen charts in the report.
* Comparative analysis across different audiences.
* Robust filtering capabilities for precise data extraction.
* Archive and unarchive functions for efficient report management.
* Schedule and deliver reports at your convenience.

There are four types of Custom Reports:

## Normal

These reports consist of normal charts that are built upon KPIs and dimensions.

## Migration

These reports consist of a chart that helps track the migration of users from one slab or segment to another slab or segment.

## Funnel

These reports consist of a sequence of steps a user takes to convert to a qualified goal. The funnel chart translates a sequence of steps customers go through to complete an objective (such as viewing the product, check out and so on).

## External

External reports can be used to embed reports that are available in databricks notebooks. In these reports, you can add charts that are built on top of Databricks Notebooks.
