  * returned\_exclusive column will become x+100

* In CPS Table,
  * current\_points will become x-100
  * points\_returned wil become x+100
  * cumulative\_points will become x-100

* If Ledger is enabled, Points Ledger table will have,
  * DEBIT entry will be created with 100 against e3 event\_log\_id
  * cps\_id will be the one that is affected above

* In PD table,

* For the points that were transferred
  * one entry will be created with deduction\_type as RETURN and points\_deducted column will have 100.
  * one entry will be created with deduction\_type as REDEEMED\_BY\_TRANSFER\_REVERTED and points\_deducted\
     column will have 100
  * points\_awarded\_ref\_id will point to the PA\_id which got affected
  * points\_awarded\_ref\_type will be POINTS\_AWARDED (if points were on bill)
  * event\_log\_id will the id as e3

* For the PABP negative points that was created 
  * one entry will be created with deduction\_type as REDEEMED\_BY\_TRANSFER and points\_deducted column will\
     have 100.
  * points\_awarded\_ref\_id will point to the PABP\_id which got affected
  * points\_awarded\_ref\_type will be POINT\_AWARDED\_BILL\_PROMOTION 
  * event\_log\_id will the id as e3

### REDEEMED\_BY\_CONVERSION

* This scenario is used when delayed accrual is enabled.

* When the delay is over, a bulk job runs and converts promised points into regular points. 

* This is when a RBC entry is made in the deduction table pointing to the PA entry of those points, but with\
   points category Promised Points . 

* After this, a new PA entry is made in the PA table but with points category Regular points. 

* *Scenario*:
  * Customer made a txn 1 of Rs.1000 on 1st Feb which has a return period of 5 days and got 100 points in his\
     promised points account
  * Customer has not returned the txn till 6th Feb midnight
  * 100 points get converted on 7th Feb morning

* *Effect*:

* **On 7th Feb**,

* In event\_log table, 
  * an event record will be inserted with event\_type\_id as 16. The id generated here is event\_log\_id

* In PA table,\
    For the existing record with DelayedAccrualPointCategory:

  * points\_exclusive column will have 100 points, 
  * redeemed\_exclusive\_value column will become 100 points
  * status column will be marked as CONSUMED\_BY\_CONVERSION

  A new record will be created in PA for Main Point Category:

  * points\_exclusive column will have 100
  * event\_log\_id with id generated in the event\_log table above
  * status will be AVAILABLE
  * rest all columns will be copied from the existing record of DelayedAccrualPointCategory

* In CPS table, For the DelayedAccrualPointCategory, 

  * current\_points will become x - 100 (x is the current\_points before this event)
  * cumulative\_points won't change
  * points\_redeemed will become x + 100

    For the Main Point Category, 
  * current\_points will become x + 100 (x is the current\_points before this event)
  * cumulative\_points column will become x + 100

* If Ledger is enabled, PL table will have an\
   For DelayedAccrualPointCategory

  * entry of 100 points with entry\_type as DEBIT 
  * cps\_id which got affected in the above CPS
  * event\_log\_id with id generated in the event\_log table

   For Main Point Category

  * entry of 100 points with entry\_type as CREDIT 
  * cps\_id which got affected in the above CPS
  * event\_log\_id with id generated in the event\_log table

* In PD table, an entry will be created with
  * deduction\_type column as REDEEMED\_BY\_CONVERSION
  * points\_deducted will be 100
  * event\_log\_id with id generated in the event\_log table
  * points\_awarded\_ref\_id will point to the PA\_id which got affected
  * points\_awarded\_ref\_type will be POINTS\_AWARDED (if points were on bill)

### RETURN\_HISTORICAL

* This is used to adjust for partial returns that happen to promised points prior to conversion

* *Scenario*:
  * Customer made a txn 1 of Rs.1000 on 1st Feb which has a return period of 5 days and got 100 points in his\
    promised points account
  * Customer has returned Rs. 500 for the txn on 4th Feb
  * 50 points get converted on 7th Feb morning
  * 50 points get returned as RETURN\_HISTORICAL

* *Effect*:

* **On 4th Feb,**

* In event\_log table
  * new entry will be created with event\_type\_id as 5, with id as e1

* In PA table,
  * points\_exclusive column will stay 100
  * returned\_exclusive\_value column will become 50
  * status column will stay as AVAILABLE

* In CPS table,
  * current\_points column will reduce by 50
  * cumulative\_points column will stay the same
  * points\_returned column will become x+50

* If Ledger is Enabled,
  * an entry\_type column with DEBIT will be created
  * points column will be 50
  * event\_log\_id column will have e1

* In PD  table,
  * an entry will be created with deduction\_type as RETURN
  * points\_deducted column will have 50.
  * event\_log\_id will the id as e1
  * points\_awarded\_ref\_id will point to the PA\_id which got affected
  * points\_awarded\_ref\_type will be POINTS\_AWARDED (if points were on bill)

* **On 7th Feb**,

* In event\_log table
  * new entry will be created with event\_type\_id as 5, with id as e2

* In PA table, For the existing record with DelayedAccrualPointCategory:

  * points\_exclusive column will stay as 100, 
  * returned\_exclusive\_column will stay as 50 
  * redeemed\_exclusive\_value column will change to 50 points
  * status column will be marked as CONSUMED\_BY\_CONVERSION

  A new record will be created in PA for Main Point Category:

  * points\_exclusive column will have 100
  * returned\_exclusive\_value column will have 50
  * event\_log\_id with id as e2
  * status will be AVAILABLE
  * rest all columns will be copied from the existing record of DelayedAccrualPointCategory

* In CPS table, For the DelayedAccrualPointCategory, 

  * current\_points will become x - 50 (x is the current\_points before this event)
  * cumulative\_points won't change
  * points\_returned column will stay as it is 
  * points\_redeemed will become x + 50

    For the Main Point Category, 
  * current\_points will become x + 50 (x is the current\_points before this event)
  * cumulative\_points column will become x + 100
  * points\_returned column will become x + 50

* If Ledger is enabled, PL table will have an 

   For DelayedAccrualPointCategory

  * entry of 50 points with entry\_type as DEBIT (mapped to delayed point category)
  * cps\_id which got affected in the above CPS
  * event\_log\_id with id as e2

  For Main Point Category

  * entry of 50 points with entry\_type as CREDIT 
  * cps\_id which got affected in the above CPS (mapped to main point category)
  * event\_log\_id with id as e2

* In PD table, For the existing DelayedAccrualPointsCategory entry

  * deduction\_type column as REDEEMED\_BY\_CONVERSION
  * points\_deducted will be 50
  * event\_log\_id with id as e2
  * points\_awarded\_ref\_id will point to the PA\_id which got affected
  * points\_awarded\_ref\_type will be POINTS\_AWARDED (if points were on bill)

  For the Main Point Category

  * deduction\_type column as RETURN\_HISTORICAL
  * points\_deducted will be 50
  * event\_log\_id with id as e2
  * points\_awarded\_ref\_id will point to the PA\_id which got affected
  * points\_awarded\_ref\_type will be POINTS\_AWARDED (if points were on bill)
