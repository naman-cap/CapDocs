# Introduction

The integration of Power BI dashboards into the Intouch Insights portal enables brands to visualise data through interactive and customizable reports. You can apply filters, explore metrics, and analyse data directly within the Intouch environment without switching platforms.

## Features

The key features of Power BI integration are:

* **Embedded Power BI dashboards**

View and interact with Power BI dashboards directly within the Insights portal.

* **Scoped workspace per organization**

  Access Power BI dashboards in organization-specific workspaces. Each brand is mapped to its own workspace to ensure data separation and security.

* **Mark reports as favourites**

  Mark frequently used or important Power BI reports as favorites. Use the **Favorites** filter or section to quickly access these reports. The favorite status persists across sessions.

* **Configure organization-specific settings**

  Use secure, organization-specific Power BI credentials and workspace configurations to manage access and data visibility.

* **View dashboards in full screen**

Expand any embedded Power BI dashboard to full-screen mode for enhanced viewing. The expanded view retains essential Insights UI elements such as the top bar and sidebar.

* **Use interactive controls**

Interact with embedded dashboards using native Power BI controls:

* Filtering: Apply filters to display only relevant data.
* Sorting:  Reorder data within tables and charts based on defined parameters.
* Slicing: Segment and explore specific subsets of data for detailed insights.

# Use cases

1. **Displaying reports with complex KPI conditions in Insights**

**Requirement**\
Display a report in Insights that uses key performance indicators (KPIs) based on complex conditions, such as calculating the number of active users during the 180 days from the reporting end date.

**Solution**\
Use embedded Power BI dashboards in Insights to create reports based on complex KPIs that cannot be configured directly in Insights.

2. **Reporting on custom fields in Insights**

**Requirement**

Create and display brand-specific reports in Insights to include data stored in custom fields, such as the number of customers who signed up for the loyalty program using a mobile device. Insights reports do not natively support reporting on custom fields.

**Solution**\
Use Power BI dashboards integrated with Insights to create and display reports using data from custom fields.

3. **Customizing report appearance**

**Requirement**\
Customize the appearance of reports, such as font types, colors, and layout, that cannot be modified within the Insights UI.

**Solution**\
Leverage Power BIâ€™s design capabilities to apply custom fonts, colors, and visual theming that can be viewed within Insights.

# Prerequisites

* **Enable Power BI in the organization and  connect to Insights**\
  To enable and set up the connection, raise a ticket with the Capillary Product Support Team. Include these details in your request:
  * Organization ID
  * Organization name
  * Reporting requirements for the dashboard

This is a paid feature and is not available by default. For pricing information, contact the Product Team.
