## Overlap Chart

An Overlap chart is a custom chart that is generated at the backend and cannot be manually created. An Overlap Chart is particularly useful when visualizing shared patterns in data. For instance, consider Customer 1 who purchases items A and B, and another customer who buys items B and C. An Overlap Chart assists in illustrating the commonality between these customers by plotting the overlapping purchase data. This visualization method is valuable for understanding and highlighting shared elements or trends among different sets of data, providing insights into patterns and intersections within diverse datasets.

## Ledger Chart

Ledger charts are charts similar to bank statements, that include an opening balance, credits, debits, and a closing balance. In the context of a points ledger (liability report), the opening balance represents active points at the report's start, credits denote issued points, debits cover expirations and redemptions, and the closing balance reflects active points at the report's end date.

As the ledger chart is a custom chart it is generated at the backend and cannot be created manually.
