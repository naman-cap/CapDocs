Use the Date filter to filter data by a specific duration. You can see some predefined periods such as WTD (start of the week until the current date), MTD (start of the month until the current date), QTD (start of the quarter until the current date), YTD (start of the year until the current date) by default. To get data from any other date range, use Custom.

You can then compare the data of a chosen duration with that of a previous to get better insights into the business performance. For example, you can compare sales of the current month with that of the previous month or with the same month of the previous year. 

To filter a report data by date range:

1. On the top-right of the report, click on the date-range drop-down

## Compare data with a previous duration

You can compare the current duration's data with that of a previous duration. The options vary based on the type of date filter.\
To compare data, select the Compare check box.

**Common stores only**: Enable this to see the comparison only across common stores in both current and previous duration. This will ignore any store that is not common in both duration ranges to provide potential data when required.

### Comparison options for each duration type

Based on the chosen option, you can see the date ranges on the drop-down as shown below
