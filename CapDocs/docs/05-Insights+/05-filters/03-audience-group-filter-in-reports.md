## Introduction

The audience group list helps filter the Insights+ reports based on customer demographics, campaigns, transactions, and other activities. There are multiple filter options in Audience Group - loyalty information, transactions, campaign and coupon, user profile, and more. You can also create an audience group filter and apply it to the report. 

To know more about how to create and use an audience group, refer [audience group creation in Engage+.](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/audience-management)

## Use Cases

The following are the use cases that help you understand the feature.

1. **Scenario 1**: Consider a scenario where an organization wants to compare the purchasing patterns (based on products purchased) year-over-year(YoY) of a high-value customer group.\
   **Solution**: This like-for-like(LFL) analysis can be accomplished using audience group filters. Open a sales report and select an audience group filter from the compare audience list that has the Transaction date and time filter applied to it. Now, you can see the product performance(based on product category) for an audience group(audience\_demo) between a specific time duration(October 2019 and October 2020).

If you do not have the audience group in the list, you can create an audience group filter from Engage+ with the **Transaction date and time**.

2. **Scenario 2**: Consider a use case where an organization wants to re-target an audience list with a minimum spend offer.\
   **Solution**: To decide the appropriate minimum spend threshold for the offer, open or create a report with an average transaction value-based banding of customers. Select the audience list to see the distribution of customers with various bands to decide the minimum spend. Now, you can see the shopping done by customers during a campaign(New Year Campaign) with value-based banding (\<5000, 5000-7000, 7000-9000, and 9000).

If you donâ€™t have the audience group in the list, you can create an audience group filter from Engage+.
